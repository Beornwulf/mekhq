# OOC Messages
performBatchall.intro.ooc=If you accept the Batchall, MekHQ will simulate the bidding process before each scenario. The\
  \ Clan forces will bid away units until they are left with the lowest number of forces they believe can conquer yours.\
  <p>Even when accepting the Batchall, fighting Clan forces - especially as the Inner Sphere - can be very challenging.\
  \ If the contract starts turning against you, remember this: it's better to lose a contract than lose your entire\
  \ campaign. Never let your pride stand in the way of keeping your personnel alive and your 'Meks intact.</p>\
  <p>If you refuse the Batchall, you will face the full might of the Clan war machine. A true challenge for those with\
  \ the guts to try it.</p>
## ARE YOU SURE?
performBatchall.areYouSure.inCharacter={0}, are you sure about this?
performBatchall.areYouSure.outOfCharacter=You will face the full strength of the Clans during this contract, and they\
  \ will regard you less favorably in future dealings.
performBatchall.areYouSure.button.confirm=(Refuse Batchall) Send the message.
performBatchall.areYouSure.button.cancel=(Bid) On second thoughts, maybe not...
