## Planetside
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.planetside.0={0} kneels in the courtyard of the compound, stripped \
  of insignia, {7} uniform bare but clean. The morning air is sharp, the silence absolute. Before {5} {8, choice, \
  0#lie|1#lies} the blade - gleaming, precise, unforgiving. {2} {8, choice, 0#pick|1#picks} it up without hesitation.\
  <p>Across from {5}, {9} stands, calm, {16} eyes fixed not on {1} but on the moment itself.</p>\
  <p>{1} draws a breath, deep and final, then drives the blade into {7} abdomen, cutting across with practiced \
  resolve. Blood blooms across {7} uniform, but {3} {8, choice, 0#make|1#makes} no sound. {6} body begins to \
  tremble.</p>\
  <p>In that instant - swift as a heartbeat - {10} rises. {15} sword flashes, a blur of motion and steel. The \
  courtyard remains still.</p>\
  <p>{10} sheathes {16} sword, expression locked, bearing the weight of honor passed from one warrior to another.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.planetside.1={0} kneels in the center of the stone courtyard, {7} \
  gaze steady, {7} expression carved from resolve. The blade before {5} rests on a folded cloth, its edge flawless, \
  untouched by hesitation.\
  <p>Wind rustles the banners above - {7} unit''s colors. {9} stands behind {5}, silent, motionless, {16} katana \
  drawn but lowered in respect.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, grips the hilt, and slides the blade into {7} abdomen with slow, deliberate force. {6} jaw \
  tightens as {3} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} it across, blood staining the stone beneath {5}. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#does|1#do} not falter.</p>\
  <p>In that final, shuddering moment, {10} steps forward, lifts {16} blade, and strikes in a single, clean arc. \
  {1}''s body slumps forward, the head tilting but held by a narrow strip of flesh.</p>\
  <p>The silence after is complete. {10} bows once, low and deep, then turns without a word, the ritual complete and\
  \ the shame extinguished.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.planetside.2={0} kneels beneath the overcast sky, rain tapping \
  softly against {7} shoulders, staining the ceremonial cloth set before {5}. {4} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t}doesn''t \
  flinch.\
  <p>The courtyard is empty, save for {9}, who stands a pace behind, katana unsheathed and held in both \
  hands, blade down.</p> \
  <p>{1} lifts the short sword with reverence - {7} last act of command - and presses the tip into {7} abdomen. {2} \
  {8, choice, 0#exhale|1#exhales}, slow and steady, then {8, choice, 0#draw|1#draws} the blade across in a \
  sharp, brutal arc. {4} breath catches, but {3} {8, choice, 0#do|1#does} not cry out. {4} {8, choice, \
  0#lean|1#leans} forward, strength failing. In that instant, {10} moves. One clean motion, steel slicing air, and\
  \ {1}''s head dips forward, the body folding over itself.</p>\
  <p>The rain keeps falling. {10} lowers {16} sword, blood dripping from the edge, and bows - deep, respectful. The \
  Combine''s honor, reclaimed in silence.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.planetside.3={0} kneels in the gravel courtyard, bare hands resting\
  \ on {7} thighs, the short blade laid precisely before {5}. {6} uniform is spotless, {7} posture perfect - \
  unyielding even now.\
  <p>Across from {5}, {9} waits, katana drawn, face unreadable behind a mask of discipline.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, grips the blade, and raises it to {7} abdomen. {2} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} \
  hesitate. The steel sinks in with a wet sound, and {3} pulls it sideways, a grimace flickering across {7} face \
  before resolve clamps down again.</p>\
  <p>Blood flows freely. {6} breath comes shallow. As {3} {8, choice, 0#start|1#starts} to pitch forward, {10} steps\
  \ in - one clean stroke, neck to shoulder. {1}''s head rolls to the ground, and {10} stands still for a moment, rain\
  \ beginning to fall, and then bows, low and wordless. The unit''s shame dies with their commander.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.planetside.4={0} kneels in the center of the parade square, \
  shoes placed neatly behind {5}, the cold steel of the tanto resting across {7} palms. The sky is clear, the air \
  still - too calm for what''s about to happen.</p>\
  <p>{6} breathing is steady. {2} {8, choice, 0#bow|1#bows} once, then {8, choice, 0#unsheathe|1#unsheathes} the \
  blade with care, as if it still deserves respect.</p> \
  <p>Behind {5}, {9} stands ready, katana drawn; the angle already measured in {16} mind. {1} grips the \
  blade, presses it to {7} abdomen, and drives it in. {2} {8, choice, 0#cut|1#cuts} across with grim precision, \
  teeth clenched, shoulders locked against the pain. As {7} body starts to sag, {10} moves. The katana whispers \
  through the air and finds its mark in a single, practiced strike. {1} folds forward, blood soaking into the earth\
  .</p>\
  <p>{10} holds the pose for a moment longer, then lowers the blade and bows. There are no words. The act speaks for\
  \ itself.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.planetside.5={0} kneels on the worn flagstones, back straight, eyes\
  \ forward, the tanto resting before {5} like a verdict. Behind {5}, {9} waits, katana raised, breath \
  held. The silence is total - no wind, no birds, just the slow heartbeat of tradition pressing down on both warriors\
  .</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches for the blade, lifts it, and without ceremony or pause, plunges it into {7} gut. {6} jaw clenches. \
  {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} the blade across, slow and deliberate, pain surging through every nerve. {6} body \
  begins to falter. In that instant, {10} steps forward and strikes. The katana arcs cleanly, stopping the fall, \
  preserving the ritual.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s body slumps gently, head bowed, blood darkening the stone. {10} lowers {16} sword, bows deeply, and \
  stands still - honor upheld, shame erased, nothing left but the silence.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.planetside.6={0} kneels in the courtyard, the stone beneath {5} \
  scrubbed clean for this final act. {5} uniform is immaculate, {7} posture flawless - {3} {8, choice, 0#face|1#faces} \
  death as {3} faced every order: without flinching.\
  <p>The tanto gleams in the sunlight, resting across {7} knees like a promise. Behind {5}, {9} stands \
  silent, katana drawn, arms steady.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, draws in a breath, and drives it into {7} belly. The cut is deep, decisive. Blood spills, \
  staining the cloth beneath {5}. {2} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} cry out. {6} body trembles, begins to collapse. \
  <p>{10} moves - one fluid motion - and the katana flashes. {1}''s head lowers as the sword completes its arc.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps back, lowers {16} blade, and bows, slow and deep. The ritual is done. The Dragon watches.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.planetside.7={0} kneels in the quiet courtyard, back straight, \
  hands steady, the tanto resting across {7} lap like a final command. The banners above {5} hang limp in the still \
  air, as if the world itself is holding its breath. Behind {5}, {9} stands motionless, katana drawn, eyes\
  \ fixed on the warrior {12} once followed into the fire.</p> \
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, the metal catching the light one last time, and plunges it into {7} abdomen. The cut is \
  clean, practiced, unforgiving. Blood wells and spills. {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} the blade across with grim \
  resolve, {7} body beginning to waver.</p>\
  <p>In that moment, {10} steps forward - silent, sure - and strikes. The katana sings through the air, and {1}''s \
  head falls forward. {10} lowers {16} blade and bows deeply, the weight of duty settling over {14} like ash. The \
  Dragon''s justice has been done.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.planetside.8={0} kneels on the tarmac of the compound, the scent of \
  incense curling through the still air. {6} uniform bears no rank, only the blood-red sash of final duty. The tanto \
  rests before {5}, its edge gleaming - sharp, precise, inevitable. Behind {5}, {9} stands at attention, \
  katana raised, breath measured.</p>\
  <p>{1} picks up the blade, bows {7} head once, and drives it into {7} abdomen. {6} breath hitches. The steel carves\
  \ across flesh with slow deliberation, {7} hands steady even as pain surges through {5}. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#lean|1#leans} forward, faltering.</p>\
  <p>In that instant, {10} moves. One step. One strike. The katana falls like judgment, and {1}''s body slumps. {10}\
  \ holds {16} stance, then lowers {5}self to the ground, bowing until {16} forehead nearly touches the stone. The \
  shame has ended. Only silence remains.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.planetside.9={0} kneels beneath an old cherry tree, its blossoms \
  fallen and scattered like the names of the dead. {6} boots are placed neatly behind {5}, {7} gloves folded beside \
  the tanto on the mat. {2} {8, choice, 0#close|1#closes} {7} eyes - not in fear, but in focus.\
  <p>Behind {5}, {9} stands ready, katana poised, the weight of the moment etched into every muscle.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, breathes in once, then drives it into {7} abdomen with unflinching force. The cut is slow, \
  deliberate, {7} face locked in stoic defiance as blood spills across the cloth.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s body begins to sag. {10} steps forward, swift and sure. The katana arcs, whispering through the air, and \
  finds its mark with surgical precision. {1}''s head lowers but does not fall. The ritual holds. {10} lowers the \
  blade and bows, the silence now sacred. The commander''s honor is restored. The Dragon need not speak.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.planetside.solo={0} kneels alone on the floor of {7} private \
  quarters, the room stripped bare of anything but a folded towel, a cleaning kit, and the tanto laid neatly before \
  {5}.\
  <p>The lights are dimmed, the ventilation unit humming softly overhead. {6} bunk is made. The red sash is tied \
  tight around {7} waist. {6} uniform is clean. There are no medals. No messages left behind. No one will be \
  coming.</p>\
  <p>{2} {8, choice, 0#lift|1#lifts} the tanto slowly, deliberately, and {8, choice, 0#rest|1#rests} it across {7} \
  thighs. {6} hands do not shake. {2} {8, choice, 0#take|1#takes} one long breath, then another, then drives the \
  blade into {7} abdomen. The pain is immediate and blinding, but {3} {8, choice, 0#hold|1#holds} firm, dragging the \
  steel across with grim determination. Blood pours down {7} legs, soaking the towel, streaking across the deck.</p>\
  <p>There is no second, no <i>Kaishakunin</i>, to end it. No katana to bring mercy. Only the long, slow agony {3} \
  knew would come.</p>\
  <p>{2} {8, choice, 0#lean|1#leans} forward, breathing in shallow, ragged pulls, until {7} arms give out. {6} body \
  slumps sideways, twitching.</p>\
  <p>The room is silent.</p>\
  <p>{0} dies alone, not because of shame, but because no one remained to bear witness. Even so, the act is\
  \ complete. {6} honor holds.</p>
## In Transit
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.inTransit.0={0} kneels on the cold steel floor of the DropShip''s \
  staging bay, the low hum of engines thrumming beneath {5} like a funeral drum. The chamber is stripped bare - no \
  banners, no insignia, just gray walls, and the sharp scent of oil and ozone.\
  <p>Before {1} lies the tanto, its blade resting on a white cloth, stark against the dull metal. Overhead, red \
  emergency lights bathe the room in a slow, pulsing glow. Behind, {9} stands motionless, katana drawn, \
  boots braced against the ship''s subtle vibrations.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, lifts the blade, and draws a breath meant to be {7} last. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#plunge|1#plunges} the steel into {7} abdomen and {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} across, {7} jaw locked against the \
  pain. Blood splatters across the deck. {2} {8, choice, 0#begin|1#begins} to falter.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps in. One strike - precise, practiced - severs the moment cleanly. {1}''s head tilts forward, body \
  folding over itself, still. The hum of the ship continues, uncaring.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers {16} blade, bows deeply on the blood-slick deck, and says nothing. In the belly of a machine built \
  for war, a warrior''s end is honored with silence.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.inTransit.1={0} kneels on the cargo deck of the DropShip, the groan\
  \ of metal echoing through the hull as the vessel idles. Overhead, fluorescent lights flicker in rhythm with the \
  ship''s systems - harsh, sterile, unflinching. The staging area has been cleared, save for a white cloth beneath the\
  \ tanto and a sealed floor drain meant for other kinds of spills.\
  <p>{1}''s uniform bears no rank. No medals. Only the crimson sash tied tightly at {7} waist. Behind {5}, Sergeant \
  {10} stands still, katana drawn, eyes locked forward, face set like stone. The air feels too dry. Too sterile.</p>\
  <p>{1} picks up the blade. No ceremony. No hesitation. {2} just {8, choice, 0#drive|1#drives} it into {7} gut and \
  {8, choice, 0#slice|1#slices} across, {7} breath caught in {7} throat, blood spilling onto the white cloth. The \
  deck vibrates faintly beneath {7}. {2} {8, choice, 0#waver|1#wavers}.</p>\
  <p>{10} moves in, smooth and silent. One clean strike. The katana arcs and lands true, stopping {1}''s collapse \
  with merciful finality. {6} head dips, still held by a fleshly tether. {6} body slumps.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps back. {11} {17, choice, 0#bow|1#bows} - low, exact, unwavering. Around them, the DropShip rumbles, \
  indifferent. In the eyes of the Dragon duty has been fulfilled, and disgrace laid to rest.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.inTransit.2={0} kneels on the hard plating of the DropShip''s inner \
  deck, the floor vibrating softly with the pulse of fusion engines. Around {5}, the cargo bay is stripped bare - no \
  audience, no ceremony, just steel walls and silence. The overhead lights cast a harsh white glare, throwing {7} \
  shadow long across the deck.\
  <p>The tanto rests before {5} on a folded white cloth. Its blade catches the light, steady and unforgiving. Behind \
  {5}, {9} stands at attention, katana drawn, body still despite the faint shudder of the DropShip.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches for the blade, {7} breath slow and even. No words. No hesitation. {2} {8, choice, 0#drive|1#drives} \
  the tanto into {7} abdomen, the cut deep and clean. {2} {8, choice, 0#drag|1#drags} it across with deliberate \
  force, blood spilling in rivulets across the deck. {6} arms shake. {6} balance wavers.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. One motion. One cut. The katana sings through the air and ends it - precise, controlled, \
  merciful. {1}''s body folds forward, head bowed, still tethered.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers {16} blade and bows, the gesture sharp and deep. The ship continues on, unaware. But in that stark, \
  bloodied space, honor has been answered.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.inTransit.3={0} kneels on the DropShip''s maintenance deck, \
  surrounded by cold metal and the low, steady hum of life-support systems. The walls are lined with tool lockers and\
  \ bulkhead piping - no shrine, no ceremony, just function. The only thing out of place is the white cloth laid \
  neatly before {5}, and the tanto glinting under the harsh utility lights.\
  <p>{2}''{8, choice, 0#ve|1#s} stripped down - no insignia, no armor, just the crimson sash, and the weight of \
  failure. Behind {5}, {9} stands still, katana in hand, {16} expression fixed, {16} boots locked against \
  the subtle shift of the DropShip.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, inhales once, and plunges it into {7} belly. The steel bites deep. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#pull|1#pulls} it across with firm, methodical precision, blood spilling onto the white cloth, pooling between the\
  \ seams in the deck plating. {6} breath rattles. {6} body starts to give.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward and ends it - one clean, silent stroke. The katana arcs and stops with purpose. {1} slumps, \
  head bowed, the final thread of dignity preserved.</p>\
  <p>{10} bows deeply, the red stain creeping toward {16} boots. The engines drone on. Outside, the stars don''t blink. \
  But here, in this quiet steel tomb, honor has been paid in full.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.inTransit.4={0} kneels on the DropShip''s secondary hold, a space \
  meant for overflow cargo - now silent, repurposed, sacred in its own grim way. The deck is bare but for a single \
  tarp beneath {5}, a folded cloth, and the tanto resting like a final sentence. Overhead, the lights buzz faintly, \
  cold and clinical. The hum of the vessel is constant, steady, uncaring.\
  <p>{6} uniform has been stripped of rank. Only the red sash remains. Behind {5}, {9} stands ready, katana \
  drawn, feet shoulder-width apart, balance honed against the subtle sway of transit. {15} eyes don''t move from {1}''s \
  back.</p>\
  <p>{1} picks up the blade. {6} hands don''t tremble. No words are spoken - none are needed. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#thrust|1#thrusts} the tanto into {7} abdomen and draws it across, slow and resolute. Blood spills fast onto the \
  tarp, dark and steaming in the recycled air. {2} {8, choice, 0#begin|1#begins} to fall.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. {15} blade arcs in a clean, perfect motion - one stroke, no sound but steel parting air. \
  {1}''s head lowers, body folding with gravity''s pull.</p>\
  <p>{10} stands over {5} for a breath, then bows - deep, precise. The hum of the ship continues. Outside, nothing \
  changes. Inside, everything has.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.inTransit.5={0} kneels in one of the DropShip''s combat bays, the \
  scent of grease and coolant still thick in the air. Overhead, hydraulic arms hang motionless, and the distant \
  clatter of tools from another deck echoes like ghosts of the living. The bay lights are dimmed by request. All \
  unnecessary systems shut down for this moment.\
  <p>Before {5} lies the tanto on a simple white cloth. No fanfare. No symbols. Just steel and silence. Behind {5}, \
  {9} stands poised, katana drawn, boots braced against the subtle vibration of the DropShip. {15} face is \
  unreadable, {16} duty absolute.</p>\
  <p>{1} takes one final breath, lifts the blade, and plunges it into {7} abdomen. {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} \
  across slowly, teeth clenched, blood running hot down {7} thighs and pooling on the deck. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#don''t|1#doesn''t} scream. {2} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} falter.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. One step, one swing. The katana arcs with surgical grace and lands true. {1}''s body folds, \
  head bowed, final posture intact.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers the blade, then bows, deep and long. No one claps. No one speaks. But within the sealed metal shell\
  \ of that DropShip, a commander dies with honor - and a soldier bears witness.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.inTransit.6={0} kneels on the grated floor of the DropShip''s\
  \ deployment bay, surrounded by shadows cast by idle war machines. The red standby lights blink in rhythm with the \
  ship''s heartbeat, casting the scene in a muted pulse of warning and farewell. The air is dense with the scent of \
  metal, hydraulic fluid, and inevitability.\
  <p>Before {5} lies the tanto on a folded white cloth, its edge catching the red light like a quiet threat. {2} {8, \
  choice, 0#wear|1#wears} no insignia, no armor - only the crimson sash across {7} waist, tied with purpose. Behind \
  {5}, {9} stands in silence, katana drawn, body still, eyes forward.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade with steady hands. {2} {8, choice, 0#draw|1#draws} in a breath, sharp and final, then drives \
  the tanto into {7} abdomen. The blade carves across, slow and sure, blood spilling down {7} legs, pooling on the \
  mesh floor. The deck continues to hum beneath {5}, indifferent.</p>\
  <p>As {3} {8, choice, 0#start|1#starts} to sag forward, {10} moves. One clean motion. The katana flashes and ends it\
  \ - a precise strike, neither rushed nor delayed. {1}''s body folds, {6} head dipping forward but still held by a \
  slither of skin.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers {16} sword, bows deeply, then remains still. Outside, stars stretch across the void. Inside, in that\
  \ steel-walled peace between wars, one warrior''s shame has been answered - and another carries it forward.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.inTransit.7={0} kneels in the DropShip''s auxiliary storage bay, \
  surrounded by empty crates and bare metal walls that echo every breath like a confession. The ship rumbles softly \
  beneath {5}, engines pushing through the void, but in this moment, the world has narrowed to blood, steel, and \
  silence. A single work light casts a harsh cone over the tanto resting on a folded cloth - {7} final companion.\
  <p>{1} wears no rank, only the red sash of obligation. Behind {5}, {9} stands still as a statue, katana \
  drawn, blade angled low, waiting for the final cue.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the tanto. There is no tremor in {7} grip. No hesitation. {2} {8, choice, 0#plunge|1#plunges} the \
  blade into {7} abdomen and pulls across, teeth clenched, breath short. Blood flows freely, painting the cloth, \
  dripping onto the steel beneath. {6} strength ebbs. {6} body begins to tilt.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. One perfect arc, honed by duty and grief, and the katana falls true. {1} slumps forward, \
  head bowed, the blade still in {7} hands. {10} lowers {16} sword and bows, slow and deep. Around {14}, the DropShip \
  hums on, unshaken. But for one warrior, the journey ends here - in silence, in steel, in honor.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.inTransit.8={0} kneels on the bare plating of the DropShip''s crew \
  staging bay, stripped of insignia, {7} uniform marked only by the crimson sash tied tight around {7} waist. The hum\
  \ of the ship surrounds {5} - constant, low, and uncaring. Overhead, a single utility light casts a hard glow on \
  the tanto before {5}, its blade resting on a worn cloth stained from earlier rites.\
  <p>Behind {1}, {9} stands ready, katana in hand, posture razor-straight. The room is sealed, empty but \
  for them. No audience. No ceremony. Just obligation and duty.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, lifts the blade, and breathes in one last time. Then {3} {8, choice, 0#drive|1#drives} the \
  tanto into {7} belly and drags it across, slow, precise. {6} body seizes, blood spilling fast across the cloth, \
  down to the seams of the steel floor. {2} {8, choice, 0#lean|1#leans} forward, strength giving way.</p>\
  <p>{10} moves. One step, one arc of steel. The katana sings through the silence and ends it cleanly. {1}''s head \
  bows forward, body folding into itself.</p>\
  <p>{10} holds still for a beat, then lowers {16} sword and bows deep, {16} shadow stretching long across the deck. \
  Outside, the stars wait. Inside, the Dragon has been served.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.inTransit.9={0} kneels on the DropShip''s maintenance sub-deck, far \
  below the hum of crew chatter or the familiar clank of ''Mek servos. Down here, it''s quiet - just the drone of the \
  fusion engine and the dim flicker of emergency lights reflecting off steel walls. The floor is cold beneath {7} \
  knees. The tanto lies before {5} on a folded strip of linen, stained faintly from past use, its blade sharp enough \
  to reflect the solemnity in {7} eyes.\
  <p>{1} wears the red sash, nothing more. Behind {5}, {9} stands still, katana drawn, arms loose but \
  ready, eyes fixed on the point beyond the act. There''s no dialogue. No ritual chant. Just breath and gravity.</p>\
  <p>{1} takes the blade, grips it tight, and drives it into {7} abdomen. {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} across \
  with control, not haste. Blood pours out, dark and fast, spattering the deck. {2} {8, choice, 0#waver|1#wavers}.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps in. The katana flashes in the dim light - one cut, clean and final. {1} folds forward, {7} head \
  dipping low but not falling. {10} lowers the blade. {11} {17, choice, 0#bow|1#bows}, slow and deep, the silence \
  thick. Above them, the ship carries on. Below, one warrior finds peace in steel, and another carries the weight of \
  it.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.seppuku.inTransit.solo={0} kneels on the deck of {7} private quarters, the \
  cramped space quiet except for the low thrum of the DropShip''s engines reverberating through the walls. The lights \
  are dimmed to a soft amber glow, casting long shadows across the floor. {6} personal effects have been packed away.\
  \ The desk is bare. The bunk is made with precision. Everything is in order.\
  <p>Before {5}, on a folded white cloth, rests the tanto - clean, sharpened, inevitable. The red sash is tied around\
  \ {7} waist, snug against the uniform stripped of all rank. There is no second, no <i>Kaishakunin</i>. No witness. \
  Just steel and silence .</p>\
  <p>{2} {8, choice, 0#bow|1#bows} once to the blade, then {8, choice, 0#lift|1#lifts} it with both hands. {6} breath \
  comes slow and steady. With a final exhale, {3} {8, choice, 0#drive|1#drives} the tanto into {7} abdomen. Pain \
  floods {5} instantly, but {3} {8, choice, 0#do|1#does} not scream. {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} the blade \
  across, slow and firm, blood spilling across the cloth and pooling at {7} knees.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s body begins to shake. {2} {8, choice, 0#sag|1#sags} forward, catching {5}self with one hand. There is no \
  mercy here. No one to end it quickly. Only the slow unwinding of life and the resolve to see it through. {2} \
  {8, choice, 0#breathe|1#breathes} through the pain, eyes fixed on the wall ahead - calm, unblinking - until breath \
  finally leaves {5}.</p>\
