FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.initialOffer.FC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>I won''t waste your time with ceremony. You''ve never cared much for pomp, and neither do I - not when the Inner \
  Sphere is coming apart at the seams.</p>\
  <p>You know who I am. You know what I''ve done. And you know this message isn''t coming through diplomatic channels \
  because this is not a conversation for diplomats. This is a choice - yours.</p>\
  <p>Let''s speak plainly.</p>\
  <p>The Federated Commonwealth is dead. Victor may still clutch at its corpse, but his absence, his naive allegiance\
  \ to ComStar, and his actions against the Clans have gutted its soul. He''s a good man - but a ghost of a ruler. He\
  \ left us leaderless, rudderless, and bleeding. I stepped in because someone had to.</p>\
  <p>I see a future. A leaner, stronger, more self-determined realm - the <b>Lyran Alliance</b>. Not a union of \
  convenience. Not a half-broken marriage of distant ideals. A nation worthy of its warriors, its citizens, and its \
  legacy.</p>\
  <p>Now I''m asking you to choose that future.</p>\
  <p>I know your record, {1}. You built <b>{18}</b> out of scrap and stubbornness. You''ve fought for the \
  Commonwealth, but more than that - you''ve fought for your people. For every tech, every pilot, every quartermaster \
  who kept your unit alive through hell.</p>\
  <p>You don''t serve politics. You serve principle.</p>\
  <p>And that''s exactly what I need right now.</p>\
  <p>The Lyran Alliance is not asking for your allegiance. <b>I am.</b></p>\
  <p>You and <b>{18}</b> would be granted full status within the Alliance Armed Forces, with expanded logistical \
  support and a direct command contract - no noble leashes, no Davion second-guessing. You''ll answer only to me. I know\
  \ how to reward loyalty - and how to protect those who commit early, when the stakes are highest.</p>\
  <p>Others will hesitate. They''ll wait and watch, afraid of history books that haven''t been written yet. But you - \
  you''ve always written your own chapter.</p>\
  <p><b>Join me, <b>{0}</b>.</b></p>\
  <p>Bring <b>{18}</b> home to Tharkad, and I will make sure your unit is never left in the dark again - never \
      left waiting for orders that never come, or reinforcements that never mattered.</p>\
  <p>Let''s build something that lasts.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.for.FC={22},\
  <p>I''ve reviewed the Archon''s message - and I believe we should take her at her word.</p>\
  <p>The Federated Commonwealth we were sworn to serve doesn''t exist anymore. The alliance is broken. Victor \
  abandoned us to chase ghosts while Tharkad and New Avalon drifted further apart with every passing month. Now the \
  division is official, and we''re sitting here pretending it hasn''t already happened.</p>\
  <p>Katrina may not be perfect, but she''s here. She''s present. She''s taking the shot when it matters. That''s more \
  than I can say for most of High Command.</p>\
  <p>Her offer isn''t just politics - it''s survival. A stable Lyran Alliance means stable contracts, logistics, and \
  protection for our families. And if we move early, we get leverage. She said it herself: first movers write their \
  own chapter.</p>\
  <p>We''ve lost too much waiting for someone to remember we''re out here. Katrina remembers. She called us by name. \
  You think she pulled <b>{18}</b> out of a hat? She knows what we''ve done. She wants what we bring.</p>\
  <p>Let the others hesitate. Let them straddle the line. We take a side now, and we''re not just another unit \
  scrounging for scraps - we''re a foundation stone in something new. Something that might actually hold.</p>\
  <p>I trust your judgment, {22}. Always have. But for what it''s worth: I''m ready to ride for Tharkad.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.against.FC={22},\
  <p>I understand you''re weighing Archon Steiner''s offer. I''ve reviewed her message and considered the \
  implications, and I feel it''s my duty to speak clearly before any final decision is made.</p>\
  <p>If we commit to her - to the Lyran Alliance - I will not go with you.</p>\
  <p>This is not rebellion, and it is not an ultimatum. It is clarity.</p>\
  <p>I respect your leadership. You''ve earned every inch of loyalty from this unit and from me. But Katrina''s rise is\
  \ not a movement I believe in. I''ve watched her maneuver her way to power through spin and sabotage, and I do not \
  trust the foundation she''s building.</p>\
  <p>If <b>{18}</b> align with her, we will become a political weapon. No matter what terms she offers, we will \
  not be free. We will be pointed. Used. Justified as proof that her actions were right all along.</p>\
  <p>Should you choose that path, I will resign my commission and seek honorable discharge. Quietly, cleanly, without\
  \ division. I''ll help with any transition needed, but I won''t follow orders that lead me down that road.</p>\
  <p>I share this now so there are no surprises. No confusion. No bitterness. You deserve honest counsel, and this is\
  \ mine.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.newsFor.FC=<h2 style="text-align:center">BREAKING: Elite FedCom Unit Declares for \
  Lyran Alliance</h2>\
  <p>In a stunning development that is rippling across military and political channels alike, the elite independent \
  regiment known as <b>{18}</b> has officially pledged its allegiance to Archon Katrina Steiner and the newly \
  redeclared Lyran Alliance.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> issued a brief statement confirming the shift, citing "clear leadership, direct engagement, and a \
  stabilizing vision for the Inner Sphere" as core reasons for the unit''s alignment with the Archon.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b>, a veteran unit with deep combat experience and a reputation for independent tactical \
  integrity, had long operated under Federated Commonwealth command. Their shift signals not just military \
  realignment - but ideological rupture within what remains of the once-mighty FedCom union.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"This isn''t just one unit changing flags. This is a vote of no confidence in the entire Davion \
  command structure." - Dr. Yusef Tenbrin, Military Analyst, New Avalon Institute of Science</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Sources within the Lyran High Command report that the unit will be redeployed shortly - though official \
  confirmation has not been provided.</p>\
  <p>News of <b>{18}</b>'' defection has ignited heated debate across FedCom-aligned worlds. With pro-Davion \
  governors calling the move "treasonous," while others, particularly on Lyran border worlds, have expressed support \
  for the unit''s decision to follow a more assertive and local leadership model.</p>\
  <p>In New Avalon, sources within Prince Victor Steiner-Davion''s inner circle say the development is "deeply \
  concerning," but stopped short of condemning the commander directly. No formal response has been issued by the AFFS\
  \ High Command as of this writing.</p>\
  <p>Not all voices within <b>{18}</b> were aligned. Leaked communications reveal that the unit''s second in \
  command, <b>{9}</b>, opposed the shift and has reportedly submitted {16} intent to resign.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"Katrina doesn''t want soldiers. She wants symbols." - Excerpt from <b>{9}</b>'' internal \
  transmission, now circulating in strategic forums</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The internal split is being watched closely by military analysts, who fear that similar fractures may erupt in \
  other mixed-allegiance units stationed near contested territories.</p>\
  <p>The timing of <b>{18}</b>'' defection is critical. With border tensions flaring between Lyran and Capellan \
  forces, and pirate raids escalating in the Periphery, the realignment gives Katrina both a symbolic and practical\
  \ advantage - one she may leverage to draw further support from unaffiliated or wavering regiments.</p>\
  <p>Whether this is the first domino or an isolated break remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: a FedCom \
  Civil War is no longer a hypothetical. It''s already begun.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.newsAgainst.FC=<h2 style="text-align:center">Renowned Unit Rejects Archon''s Bid</h2>\
  <p>In a move with major implications for the fractured House Steiner-Davion political order, the elite combat unit \
  known as <b>{18}</b> has officially declined Archon Katrina Steiner''s invitation to join the newly redeclared \
  Lyran Alliance.</p>\
  <p>The announcement came late last night, following what sources described as "tense internal debate" among the \
  unit''s senior staff. <b>{0}</b> issued a brief transmission declaring <b>{18}</b>'' continued loyalty to the\
  \ Federated Commonwealth and Prince Victor Steiner-Davion''s legitimate authority.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"We serve a united vision," the statement read. "We do not take orders from those who shatter what others bled \
  to build."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> had been heavily courted by Lyran political agents over the last several weeks, with Archon \
  Katrina herself delivering a direct, classified offer to the unit. Analysts describe the rejection as a "severe \
  blow" to Katrina''s campaign to bring high-profile military assets under her banner in the early stages of what is \
  rapidly escalating towards a civil war.</p>\
  <p><b>{9}</b>, the {1}''s second in command, is believed to have been a vocal opponent of the alliance shift, \
  describing the offer as "a political weapon dressed up as a rescue mission." {11} reportedly told <b>{0}</b> {12} \
  would resign {16} post if the unit changed sides - though such a resignation was ultimately unnecessary.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"This decision wasn''t about loyalty to a flag - it was about recognizing who''s trying to preserve \
  peace, and who''s burning bridges for a throne." - Internal source close to <b>{18}</b> command</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Military observers expect the rejection to bolster morale in Davion-aligned commands and potentially sway other \
  hesitant units still weighing Katrina''s overtures. <b>{18}</b> are respected not just for their combat record,\
  \ but for their fiercely independent code of honor - making their refusal all the more symbolic.</p>\
  <p>Still, tensions remain high. Lyran Defense Force patrols near the frontier have doubled in the past 48 hours, \
  and at least one Davion logistical convoy was turned away from a Tharkad-run depot without explanation.</p>\
  <p>Sources within the AFFS suggest <b>{18}</b> may be redeployed to reinforce vulnerable worlds along the \
  Terran corridor, a sign that High Command intends to solidify its core before any formal engagements occur.</p>\
  <p>Whether Katrina''s forces respond with diplomacy - or escalation - remains to be seen. But with every decision like \
  this, the center of the Federated Commonwealth either holds... or cracks.</p>\

# ComStar Schism
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.initialOffer.CS=<h2 style="text-align:center">Transmitted via HPG Node - Priority \
  Omega Directive</h2>\
  <h3><b>From:</b> Precentor Demona Aziz, Voice of the Word, Servant of the Light\
  <br>Location:</b> Atreus (FWL)\
  <br>Date:</b> September 21, 3052</h3>\
  <p><b>To the faithful, the questioning, and those who still honor the flame of Blake</b></p>\
  <p>The veil has fallen. The heresy is no longer hidden. I come not to whisper, but to reveal.</p>\
  <p>Primus Myndo Waterly, chosen steward of Blake''s Will, was <b>murdered</b> - assassinated by the traitor \
  <b>Anastasius Focht</b> with the blessing of the secularist Sharilar Mori. Her blood was spilled within the \
  sanctum, and her memory is now buried beneath lies and "reform."</p>\
  <p>They speak of peace. Of neutrality. Of modernity. But what they have done is nothing less than <b>apostasy</b>. \
  They have stripped ComStar of its soul and draped it in sterile robes. They make deals with the Clans. They abandon\
  \ the Covenant. They spit on prophecy.</p>\
  <p>Let this message burn through every node of this shattered Sphere:</p>\
  <p><b>We do not recognize the authority of the usurpers on Terra.</b> We reject the puppet Primus. We reject \
  Focht''s secularist ComStar. We reject the surrender of spirit in favor of political convenience.</p>\
  <p><b>We are the Word of Blake.</b></p>\
  <p>We carry forward the sacred mission unbroken - from Jerome Blake to Myndo Waterly and now to us. On Atreus, we \
  have established the Seat of the True Word. We will guard the sacred knowledge. We will preserve the Code. And we \
  will not bow to those who murdered our faith in the name of diplomacy.</p>\
  <p>This is not rebellion. This is <i>reclamation</i>.</p>\
  <p>To those who still hold Blake in their hearts, your silence is no longer righteous. Join us. Find your calling \
  again. Our sanctuaries are open, our archives intact, our purpose clear.</p>\
  <p>To those who follow the false ComStar: you may own the machines, but you have lost the Message. We do not seek \
  your war - but we will not retreat from our truth.</p>\
  <p>Mark these words, and mark this day. The Word has not ended. It has been reborn.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.for.CS={22},\
  <p>I read the transmission three times before I believed it. Then I read the encoded brief from Atreus. I \
  cross-verified Waterly''s death certificate - if you can even call it that.</p>\
  <p>She was <b>murdered</b>, {22}. Shot in the back by Anastasius Focht. Covered up by Sharilar Mori. All while \
  the so-called "reformers" smiled for the press and handed our sacred legacy over to Clan filth and secular \
  bureaucrats.</p>\
  <p>I can''t stomach it. I won''t.</p>\
  <p>You always said <b>{18}</b> stood for something more than orders. That we were about loyalty. Principle. \
  Truth. If that''s still true - <i>if that ever meant anything</i> - then I''m asking you to act now, before this unit is\
  \ dragged into a political lie dressed in protocol and neutrality.</p>\
  <p>Precentor Demona Aziz has called the faithful home. The <b>Word of Blake</b> isn''t a fringe cult. It''s what''s \
  left of the soul they tried to kill with Waterly. It''s the real mission. The true message. And they''re not asking \
  for blind loyalty - they''re offering clarity. A place to stand that isn''t made of compromise and cowardice.</p>\
  <p>You still have time to lead us there. To make the call. But I won''t lie to you: if we keep pretending neutrality\
  \ is honorable in the face of <b>murder and heresy</b>, some of us will stop pretending. I''m not the only one \
  who''s made up their mind. Others are watching. Others are <i>ready</i></p>\
  <p>This is the last moment before the line is drawn, {22}. Cross it with purpose - or be left behind.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.against.CS={22},\
  <p>I know you''re receiving pressure from all sides, especially from those swept up by Precentor Aziz''s broadcast. \
  You''ve always listened to both sides. I trust you''ll hear this one too - before we mistake grief and outrage for \
  truth.</p>\
  <p>I read the same message. I saw the same claims. And I understand why people are shaken. The death of Myndo \
  Waterly - however tragic - is not proof of conspiracy. But this conspiracy <i>is</i> proof of crisis.</p>\
  <p>What the Precentor Martial did, he did under scrutiny. He presented the circumstances of Waterly''s final actions\
  \ and the justification for intervention to the <b>First Circuit</b>. Not in shadows. Not with daggers. With \
  <i>evidence</i> - and the weight of Jerome Blake''s original writings behind him.</p>\
  <p>I''ve read the Blake Codex. It was never about gods. It was about <b>preservation, reason, restraint</b>. He \
  feared the cycle of destruction, and he built ComStar to be the eye in the storm, not a flaming sword in it.</p>\
  <p>What Aziz is building isn''t a faith - it''s a fortress. She''s taking Waterly''s death and wrapping it in myth, \
  calling it martyrdom so she can seize control without oversight. It''s not prophecy - it''s a <b>power grab</b>.</p>\
  <p>I say this with conviction: <b>now is not the time to go back into Plato''s cave.</b> We''ve fought for \
  clarity. For truth earned in the blood and fire of Tukayyid. This moment - this messy, complicated, rational moment \
  - is <b>the light</b>. To follow Aziz is to turn away from it because it''s too bright, too hard, too \
  uncomfortable.</p>\
  <p>If others can''t see that, I pity them. But I hope you still can. I know you taught me to.</p>\
  <p>We''re soldiers. We''re not prophets. Let''s not mistake shouting for wisdom.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.newsFor.CS=<h2 style="text-align:center">ComStar Cracks: A Schism Shakes the Sphere</h2>\
  <p>ComStar, long the seemingly untouchable guardian of interstellar communication and spiritual stewardship, has \
  fractured. What began as quiet discontent within Terra''s ivory halls has become a rupture felt across the Inner \
  Sphere - and the consequences may be only just beginning.</p>\
  <p>A respected ComGuard unit, known as <b>{18}</b>, has announced its defection - not just from ComStar command, \
  but from the entire secular direction it has taken under Primus Sharilar Mori and Precentor Martial Anastasius \
  Focht. Their allegiance now lies with a splinter faction calling itself <b>the Word of Blake</b>.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"We serve the true mission," said a brief statement from <b>{18}</b>. "And we will not be \
  complicit in the burial of truth beneath protocol and public relations."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Led by former Precentor Demona Aziz, the Word of Blake has claimed moral succession to Jerome Blake''s vision. \
  While the Mori-Focht administration insists on a secular, non-religious mandate for ComStar, the Word claims that \
  the recent reforms represent a betrayal - not progress.</p>\
  <p>Aziz''s followers are not merely disillusioned bureaucrats. They''ve taken with them HPG technicians, ComStar \
  archivists, and - most dangerously - military personnel. Several ComGuard units have quietly gone silent. \
  <b>{18}</b> are simply the first to go public.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>When spiritual extremists seize logistical infrastructure, that''s not a religious debate. That''s \
  a security crisis." - Dr. Helena Tarns, Strategic Risk Council, Lyran Alliance</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Rumors swirl that Word of Blake forces are consolidating on Atreus in the Free Worlds League, with Free Worlds \
  officials either unable or unwilling to publicly intervene. In some cases, Word personnel have reportedly taken \
  control of local HPG relays under "emergency continuity protocols."</p>\
  <p>The heart of the crisis lies in one chilling question: <b>Who controls the HPG network?</b></p>\
  <p>ComStar''s promise - its power - has always rested on neutrality. From the Periphery to Tharkad, communication \
  across light-years depended on that neutrality. Now, with Word of Blake operatives occupying some nodes and ComStar\
  \ loyalists holding others, coordination is fragmenting.</p>\
  <p>The First Circuit has issued reassurances that most of the Inner Sphere''s primary data corridors remain stable. \
  But military planners are already preparing contingency protocols for a future in which message traffic is no \
  longer guaranteed or secure.</p>\
  <p>Some analysts see this as the collapse of the so-called "Invisible Empire" - a recent idea that ComStar has \
  been quietly steering the fate of the Inner Sphere through control of both technology and truth. If ComStar can no \
  longer speak with one voice, let alone protect its own unity, what remains of its mystique?</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"We may be witnessing the final unraveling of Blake''s order," said Professor Ren Takagawa of the \
  University of Luthien. "Or the birth of a new war, one of ideology, fought not over territory - but over \
  meaning."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>For now, ComStar remains in control of Terra and the majority of the core HPG hubs. But the Word of Blake''s \
  influence is spreading - particularly in systems disillusioned with ComStar''s recent compromises with the Clans and \
  actions taken against House sovereignty.</p>\
  <p>The defection of <b>{18}</b> - respected, decorated, and fiercely independent - sends a chilling signal to \
  others who may be wavering.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"If a ComGuard unit walks away from Terra''s command to join a theocratic movement, what''s stopping \
  the next twenty?" - Lt. General Mira Feldt, 1st Davion Guards</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>One thing is clear: the age of unquestioned ComStar authority is over. The Inner Sphere must now ask itself if \
  it''s ready for a galaxy where the lines between belief, bandwidth, and battle are no longer cleanly drawn.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.newsAgainst.CS=<h2 style="text-align:center"><b>{18}</b> Reject Word of Blake, \
  Back ComStar Unity</h2>\
  <p>As the Word of Blake splinter group continues its campaign to recruit ComGuard personnel and seize \
  communications hubs, one of ComStar''s most respected independent units has drawn a clear line.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b>, a semi-autonomous ComGuard unit, issued a public statement today condemning the Word of Blake \
  movement and reaffirming their loyalty to the secular leadership of ComStar under Primus Sharilar Mori and \
  Precentor Martial Anastasius Focht.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"We will not trade reason for ritual. We will not follow fanatics into the dark." - <b>{0}</b>, \
  <b>{18}</b></i></p></blockquote>\
  <p><b>{0}</b>''s statement directly addressed recent outreach from Word of Blake operatives, including a widely \
  distributed HPG message from Precentor Demona Aziz calling for ComGuards to "preserve the true faith" and abandon \
  the "heretic leadership on Terra."</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"We''ve seen the so-called truth," {1} added. "We''ve read the same Blake Codex they twist to justify power grabs \
  and cult rhetoric. What the Precentor Martial showed the First Circuit wasn''t heresy. It was clarity. What Aziz \
  offers is the same old tyranny - only with scripture for bullets."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p><b>{18}</b>'' declaration comes at a critical moment, as several lesser-known ComGuard elements have \
  reportedly gone silent, with unconfirmed reports of defections and rogue operations along the Free Worlds League \
  frontier.</p>\
  <p>By going public, <b>{18}</b> have become the first high-profile military unit to reject Word of Blake \
  ideology while remaining fully operational within the ComStar structure. Sources within Terra suggest the First \
  Circuit views this move as a morale-boosting victory amid the ongoing ideological battle.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"The Word of Blake has momentum - but <b>{18}</b> have weight," said sociopolitical analyst\
  \ Ayra Simlen. "They''re combat-proven, independent, and respected. Their refusal gives others permission to say no \
  without feeling like traitors to faith or tradition."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Word of Blake supporters continue to push the narrative that secularization is a betrayal of Blake''s intent, \
  citing Myndo Waterly''s death as martyrdom. But <b>{18}</b>'' intelligence branch released a redacted briefing \
  alongside their statement, supporting Focht''s timeline of events and reiterating that Waterly was removed for \
  authorizing <i>Operation Scorpion</i>, a plan widely condemned as genocidal and destabilizing.</p>\
  <p><b>{9}</b>, of <b>{18}</b>, issued {16} own remarks: "We all want meaning. But there is no honor in \
  setting fire to the institutions that protect the Sphere just because the light makes you uncomfortable. We will \
  not confuse zeal for truth."</p>\
  <p>The schism has raised fears over the stability of the HPG network, but units like <b>{18}</b> remaining \
  loyal may be a key factor in holding the line - both technologically and ideologically.</p>\
  <p>In response to mounting public anxiety about the reliability of interstellar communications, ComStar issued an \
  official statement through its Terra-based press office:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"There is no danger to the HPG network - <b>not now, not ever</b>. The Inner Sphere''s lines of \
  communication remain fully operational and under the stewardship of ComStar. The sanctity of the network is our \
  highest duty, and no amount of splinter ideology will change that." - ComStar Public Affairs</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Analysts remain cautious. While the majority of HPG nodes remain secure, scattered incidents of regional \
  interference and "unusual transmission patterns" have already been reported near Capellan and Free Worlds \
  territories - many suspected to be under Word of Blake influence.</p>\
  <p>Still, <b>{18}</b>'' firm rejection of Blakist ideology provides a rare point of reassurance. Whether others \
  will follow <b>{18}</b>'' example - or fall under the sway of the Word - remains to be seen. But \
  one thing is now undeniable: the fight for ComStar''s soul is no longer just theological. It is logistical, \
  operational, and real.</p>
# ESPINOSA_COUP
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.initialOffer.ARC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>By now you''ve heard my public address. Let me repeat what matters most:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"With the unanimous support of the Founding Houses, I have assumed control of the Aurigan \
  Coalition."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>This was not a coup. It was a correction. The Founding Houses have seen the truth - seen the danger of Kamea \
  Arano''s naive vision. Her heart may be noble, but noble hearts make poor shields in the Periphery. She would have \
  plunged us into weakness, disunity, and external manipulation.</p>\
  <p>I did not take power for ambition''s sake. I took it because someone had to. Because stability matters. Because \
  the Coalition must be strong if it is to survive the decades ahead. And I will not allow it to crumble under \
  romantic slogans and inherited titles.</p>\
  <p>You, {22}, understand the price of disorder. The cost of hesitation. You lead a professional unit with \
  reach and influence. I know what <b>{18}</b> are capable of. I know how valuable your presence could \
  be to the Directorate.</p>\
  <p>So I''m offering you this, once: join us. Pledge your strength to me and the Aurigan Directorate, and you will \
  receive a full formal commission, prioritized resupply, and a command charter under Directorate Strategic Command. \
  You''ll maintain operational freedom - and more importantly, you''ll help secure the Reach against collapse.</p>\
  <p>But hear me clearly: neutrality is not sustainable. Kamea has chosen rebellion. If you choose to follow her, you\
  \ place yourself outside the law. I will treat you accordingly.</p>\
  <p>I want your talents aligned with the future. Not scattered across the battlefield as a cautionary tale. I offer \
  peace, purpose, and position. Refuse - and you will face force, swift and decisive.</p>\
  <p>My oath is unchanged:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>Stand down and you will not be harmed. But resist, and you will be fired \
  upon.</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>I await your response, {22}.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.for.ARC={22},\
  <p>I''ve waited as long as I could, hoping we''d chart a course through this storm. But with every hour we stay \
  silent, the cracks in this unit grow deeper. You need to make a choice. And you need to make it now.</p>\
  <p>Lord Espinosa is not a tyrant. He is the architect of the Coalition''s infrastructure, the spine of our \
  stability, and the only adult in a room full of titles and dreams. He didn''t seize power for glory. He did it \
  because someone had to put their hand on the wheel before the Coalition drove itself into the sea.</p>\
  <p>And what does House Arano offer in return? A throne cloaked in tragedy and wrapped in fantasy. Kamea Arano \
  speaks of unity and restoration - but what she really dreams of is the Star League. She venerates a corpse. A \
  government that brutalized the Periphery for over a century. An empire that called our homes "backwaters" and \
  punished independence with orbital bombardments.</p>\
  <p>We are asked to shed blood for that vision? To defend a dynasty that wants to make the Reach a relic? No. I will\
  \ not die for nostalgia.</p>\
  <p>The Directorate offers us something real: command, resources, legitimacy. Santiago Espinosa treats us like \
  professionals. Like allies. Not pawns in some royal pageant staged for League loyalists and lost nobles.</p>\
  <p>And here''s what you need to hear, {22} - because too many are whispering it, and not enough are saying it \
  aloud:</p>\
  <p>This unit is already choosing sides. This ends in blood.</p>\
  <p>Make the call, {1}. I know you''re a good commander. Don''t let this unit die over a throne built on League \
  propaganda and aristocratic sentimentality.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.against.ARC={22},\
  <p>I have followed you through fire. Through battles where the odds made no sense and the orders came late. I''ve \
  never once questioned your judgment.</p>\
  <p>So please understand that when I say what I''m about to say, it is not out of disloyalty. It is out of conscience. \
  Out of duty - not to a flag or a chain of command - but to what''s <i>right</i>.</p>\
  <p><b>If you side with Santiago Espinosa, I will not follow you.</b></p>\
  <p>He is a tyrant. You''ve seen the broadcasts. But you haven''t seen the body piles being burned. You haven''t heard \
  the whispers coming about midnight round-ups. About prisoners disappearing in bulk. About mass graves - some with \
  Coalition seals still on the uniforms.</p>\
  <p>And if you doubt the rumors, just look at the timing. He didn''t wait months. He didn''t wait a year. He moved \
  <b>on the day of Kamea''s coronation</b> - just weeks after both her parents were killed in a JumpShip "accident" that\
  \ now feels anything but accidental.</p>\
  <p>This isn''t a transition. It''s a purge. This is what tyranny looks like when it still thinks it''s being subtle.</p>\
  <p>I know you''re hearing pressure from inside. I know others are already laying their pieces on the board. But this\
  \ is not a matter of politics, {1}. This is a moral line. And if you cross it - if you lead <b>{18}</b> into \
  Espinosa''s shadow - then I will do what must be done.</p>\
  <p>I will take control of this unit. I will not let our colors be used as cover for atrocities. I will not let our \
  people become another tool in a murderer''s hand. You''re still my commander - but if you march us behind that man, you\

  <p>This ends now. One way or another.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.newsFor.ARC=<h2 style="text-align:center">Another Day, Another Uprising: Aurigan \
  Turmoil Underscores Periphery Instability</h2>\
  <p>Civil unrest has once again ignited in the Periphery. This time, it''s the Aurigan Coalition that has plunged \
  into internal war. The would-be coronation of High Lady Kamea Arano was violently disrupted when her uncle, Lord \
  Santiago Espinosa, seized power and declared himself High Lord of a newly formed "Aurigan Directorate."</p>\
  <p>Local broadcasts described the event as a "stabilizing intervention." Critics in nearby systems are calling it \
  what it is: a coup.</p>\
  <p>Periphery politics have always been turbulent, but the speed and intensity of the Aurigan fracture have raised \
  new alarms. Less than a decade after the Coalition declared independence from both Canopian and Taurian pressure, \
  it now joins the long list of microstates too brittle to survive without collapsing inward.</p>\
  <p>In a show of early strength, the Directorate received immediate vocal support from several regional powers - \
  including a surprising endorsement from an elite regional command known as <b>{18}</b>, led by <b>{0}</b>.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"We support High Lord Espinosa''s bid to preserve order in the Reach," {1} stated in a public \
  address. "The Coalition has no future if it tears itself apart chasing dead empires and fractured \
  crowns."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Also throwing its diplomatic weight behind the Directorate is the <b>Taurian Concordat</b>, whose Defense \
  Ministry released a carefully worded statement praising Espinosa''s "firm grasp of strategic realities" and pledging\
  \ economic assistance and border cooperation in the event of continued unrest.</p>\
  <p>But even with high-profile endorsements, the Directorate faces serious challenges. Reports from Panzyr, Guldra, \
  and Independence suggest that resistance loyal to House Arano is organizing, with smaller militias and rogue naval \
  units refusing to recognize Espinosa''s authority. Civilian casualties have already been reported in multiple \
  districts across the Coromodir system, with unverified rumors of political arrests and "containment camps" on \
  Weldry.</p>\
  <p>Observers have expressed concern that the Directorate''s foundation may be too reliant on force and fear to \
  endure.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"You can''t bomb your way into legitimacy," said Dr. Alton Reyes of the Federated Suns \
  Diplomatic Academy. "Espinosa may win the war, but he won''t build a nation on the rubble of \
  trust."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Critics have also questioned the wisdom of <b>{18}</b>'' involvement, with several retired AFFS generals \
  warning that the unit may be squandering its reputation by tying itself to an untested regime in a collapsing \
  border state.</p>\
  <p>The broader issue, however, is what this latest uprising says about the viability of Periphery microstates. The \
  Aurigan Coalition was meant to be a model - an alternative to Great House dominance, built on local alliances and \
  decentralized power. Instead, it now joins the long list of Periphery regions undone by noble infighting, economic \
  pressure, and unresolved trauma from centuries of Star League subjugation.</p>\
  <p>As one Lyran analyst quipped, "We should stop giving these places names and just number the collapses."</p>\
  <p>Still, with seasoned forces like <b>{18}</b> at its side, and Taurian influence giving it strategic depth, \
  the Directorate may yet hold. But whether it becomes a stable regime or just another footnote in Periphery history \
  books remains uncertain.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.newsAgainst.ARC=<h2 style="text-align:center">Arano Rises - But Can the Reach \
  Endure?</h2>\
  <p>The civil war in the Aurigan Reach has entered its next phase, and with it, yet another cautionary tale in the \
  fragility of Periphery microstates. This week, an elite house unit known as <b>{18}</b> officially declared \
  their loyalty to deposed ruler <b>Kamea Arano</b>, joining the growing resistance now formally organized as the \
  <i>Arano Restoration</i>.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"We fight not for a title, but for the soul of the Reach," said <b>{0}</b> in a public \
  broadcast. "High Lady Kamea Arano represents legitimate rule and the will of her people. We will not kneel to a \
  usurper."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The announcement electrified the Magistracy of Canopus, where Arano has long enjoyed popular and political \
  goodwill. Public rallies erupted in several Canopian cities, while Lady Ana Maria Centrella praised Arano''s \
  "unyielding devotion to her people" and condemned Lord Santiago Espinosa''s Directorate as a "coward''s throne, built\
  \ with treachery and fear."</p>\
  <p>In addition to securing the support of <b>{18}</b>, the Restoration has begun actively recruiting mercenary\
  \ commands to bolster its forces. These include contracts for planetary defense, recon, and targeted strikes \
  against Directorate logistical hubs. With most of the Coalition''s standing military under Directorate control, the \
  Restoration is building its war machine from scratch.</p>\
  <p>But this leads to a more troubling question: <b>how are they paying for it?</b> With trade routes fractured and \
  major noble houses embattled or in hiding, financial resources are limited. Some analysts believe Canopus is \
  providing covert funding. Others suspect sympathetic Aurigan nobles are liquidating planetary assets and stockpiles\
  \ to stay afloat - burning the seed corn to fight a war with no guaranteed harvest.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"It''s one thing to inspire loyalty," said Dr. Alton Reyes of the Federated Suns Diplomatic \
  Academy. "It''s another to meet a mercenary''s invoice when you''re governing from a stolen \
  DropShip."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The deeper problem isn''t just military - it''s structural. The Aurigan Coalition was always a tenuous experiment: a\
  \ patchwork of noble alliances, limited industry, and barely cohesive planetary cultures. The Directorate''s coup \
  may have lit the fuse, but the war itself is exposing deep fractures that were already present.</p>\
  <p>Even if Kamea Arano wins - if she retakes Coromodir, crushes Espinosa''s regime, and reclaims her throne - the \
  economic, political, and military cost may be fatal. Food production has dropped, key DropPorts have been bombed or\
  \ blockaded, and foreign trade has collapsed almost overnight.</p>\
  <p>Observers worry that victory for the Restoration may still lead to a slow collapse - not because of Espinosa, but \
  because of what the Reach was never strong enough to survive in the first place: time.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"Even if she wins," said Professor Elix Navarro of the Lyran Institute of Political Science, \
  "she inherits a state that''s already on fire and running out of water."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p><b>{18}</b>'' decision to throw in with Arano reflects both moral conviction and strategic risk. It commits \
  them to a long and unpredictable campaign. If the Restoration falters - or if the promises of payment and postwar \
  authority prove empty - they may find themselves stranded in a failed state with no allies and no exit.</p>\
  <p>The Restoration is loud, fast, and idealistic. And in the Periphery, that''s often the prelude to collapse. Kamea\
  \ Arano may yet be the queen who reclaims her crown. But whether she can keep her kingdom from crumbling in her \
  hands is an entirely different battle - and it''s one that even victory on the battlefield might not win.</p>
