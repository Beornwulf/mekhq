FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.DC={0},\

  <p>You will not march again under our banner. The Republic remembers its champions - and its failures.</p>
FactionCensureEvent.inCharacter.DISBAND.TD=You''re done. You lost multiple raids, let captives escape, and left salvage\
  \ on the field. You''re a disgrace to the Dominions and a waste of good guns.\
  <p>By order of command council, this unit is disbanded. Surviving personnel will be split among working warbands. \
  Officers will be reviewed - some of you might even live.</p>\
  <p>Your banner''s ashes will be scattered in the garbage chute. That''s all the ceremony you''ve earned.</p>
