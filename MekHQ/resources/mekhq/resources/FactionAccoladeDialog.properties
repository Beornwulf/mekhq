## Messages
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.ooc=Your standing with {0} is on the rise.
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.innerSphere={9}, our unit''s been flagged in recent data requests \
  traced back to {10}''s internal military and administrative systems. From what I can tell, this is tied directly to \
  our support operations in the region.\
  <p>They''re impressed. We''ve earned a reputation within as a dependable and capable presence, and it looks like \
  their command structure is starting to take us seriously.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep the pressure steady and the results clean. They could become a useful ally - or at the very least, a \
  friendly DropPort.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.CC={9}, our unit has shown up in several high-level search logs \
  from within the Confederation''s military command structure. It''s clear we''ve attracted attention from above.\
  <p>That could mean opportunity - or increased scrutiny. Either way, we need to stay sharp and keep our record clean. \
  The Chancellor doesn''t watch casually.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.DC={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent data pulls \
  originating from Combine High Command. We are being observed.\
  <p>This is not unexpected, given our recent record. Recognition from above is earned - but it also brings increased \
  expectations. The Dragon does not reward lightly, nor forgive failure.</p>\
  <p>I recommend we operate with absolute precision. Now is the time to prove we are worthy of the attention we''ve \
  drawn.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.LA={9}, I ran a routine systems check and found that our unit''s \
  name has come up in several flagged searches from LCAF senior staff. We''ve clearly landed on someone''s radar.\
  <p>Given our recent performance, I''d say this is the start of something bigger - assignments, evaluations, maybe even \
  patronage. Of course, it also means we''ll be under closer scrutiny.</p>\
  <p>Let''s make sure what they see keeps us moving up, not sideways.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FS={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent searches coming out \
  of Federated Suns High Command. It looks like we''ve drawn attention from above.\
  <p>Given how we''ve been performing, it''s not a surprise - but it is a responsibility. They''re watching now, and that \
  means every move counts more than ever.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep showing them that their trust - or curiosity - is well-placed.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FWL={9}, I''ve reviewed recent network activity, and our unit has \
  been flagged in multiple search queries from different branches of League command. We''re on the radar now - possibly \
  in more than one bloc.\
  <p>That could open doors, or it could mean someone''s sizing us up. Either way, we should stay sharp and keep our \
  profile clean. In the League, attention from above can shift quickly - best we guide it, not chase it.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.TH={9}, our unit has been flagged in multiple high-clearance \
  search protocols traced back to Hegemony Command. We''re officially on their watchlist - likely under performance review.\
  <p>This isn''t cause for concern - yet. It''s a signal that our actions are aligning with greater strategic interests. In\
  \ the Hegemony, recognition from above often precedes increased expectations.</p>\
  <p>Let''s ensure we continue to operate in a way that honors the legacy we represent.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.ROS={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent search activity \
  originating from upper echelons of Republic Command. We''re clearly under review - most likely due to our recent field\
  \ performance.\
  <p>This kind of attention could lead to expanded responsibilities. It also means we''ll be held to a higher standard \
  from here on out.</p>\
  <p>Let''s make sure we continue to reflect the values this Republic was built on - stability, integrity, and trust.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.SL={9}, our unit has been flagged in multiple search queries \
  issued by central Star League command. We appear to be under observation by higher strategic authorities.\
  <p>This likely reflects our operational record to date - and signals that we may be considered for more critical \
  assignments. The League does not act without purpose.</p>\
  <p>Let''s ensure that everything we do from this point forward upholds the ideals we serve: unity, order, and the \
  preservation of peace.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FC={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent data pulls from the \
  Federated Commonwealth''s joint command systems. We''ve drawn the eye of higher leadership - likely in recognition of \
  our recent actions.\
  <p>That kind of visibility comes with opportunity - and scrutiny. Let''s stay focused and disciplined. If we''re being \
  watched, let''s give them something worth backing.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.periphery={9}, we''ve been flagged in a string of intel queries \
  coming from inside {10} - government channels, militia databases, even administrative logs. From the look of it, word \
  of our recent actions on their behalf is spreading fast.\
  <p>They''re watching us now, not as a threat, but as an asset. A force that gets results.</p>\
  <p>Might be worth leaning into that. Relationships like this don''t happen often out here - and when they do, they \
  can pay off in ways C-Bills can''t.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.RWR={9}, our unit has appeared in recent search activity \
  originating from Rim Worlds central authority. We''ve drawn attention from the upper chain - possibly the Directorate \
  itself.\
  <p>This could mean recognition. It could also mean evaluation. Either way, we continue forward with \
  discipline and absolute alignment to the Republic''s vision.</p>\
  <p>Stay sharp. In the Republic, attention is never neutral.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.TC={9}, our unit''s been flagged in recent searches by senior \
  Concordat defense officials. Word''s gotten around - we''ve made an impression.\
  <p>That kind of attention can mean trust, or testing. Either way, it''s on us to show we''re worth the faith. Let''s \
  keep doing what we''ve been doing - clean, solid work that speaks louder than promises ever could.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MOC={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent strategic reviews \
  coming out of Magistracy high command. It''s clear we''ve attracted some attention - likely due to our recent \
  effectiveness.\
  <p>This kind of visibility tends to lead somewhere - contracts, evaluations, or possibly an invitation. Let''s make \
  sure what they see reinforces the value we bring to the Magistrix.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.OA={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent inquiry records from \
  Outworlds Alliance command. We''ve drawn some attention - likely from the Council''s strategic oversight division.\
  <p>It''s not something they do lightly. That kind of interest means they''re watching what we''re building out here - and \
  weighing what more we could take on.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep our operations clean, precise, and true to the Alliance''s values. We didn''t ask for this attention, \
  but we''ve earned it.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MH={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent data sweeps from \
  upper-tier command in the Marian Hegemony. Word is, someone close to the Caesar''s circle is watching.\
  <p>This isn''t the kind of attention we can afford to waste. Recognition here means expectation - of strength, of \
  discipline, of results. Let''s give them exactly that.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.CS={9}, our unit has been referenced in several flagged \
  information queries originating from within ComStar. The nature of the searches was...specific, and they weren''t \
  routed through public channels.\
  <p>This isn''t casual interest. The Order is aware of us - and watching.</p>\
  <p>We should proceed with caution. When ComStar looks too closely, it''s rarely just to admire the work.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.WOB={9}, our unit has appeared in recent searches traced back to \
  Word of Blake enclaves - specifically the inner doctrinal networks. The kind they don''t access without purpose.\
  <p>It''s not praise. It''s prophecy. They believe we''ve aligned with the Pattern... or that we might disrupt it.</p>\
  <p>Either way, the True Believers are looking at us now. Best we stay sharp, stay moving, and remember - attention \
  from the Word rarely ends with just observation.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.clan={9}, our unit has been marked in recent internal Watch \
  searches - originating from senior {10} command. They are watching us.\
  <p>This is not flattery. It is evaluation. Attention in the Clans is never casual - it is earned or it is provoked.</p>\
  <p>We must continue to operate with strength, clarity, and discipline. If they are measuring us, then let them find \
  proof of worth, not weakness.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MG={9}, we''ve just received notice from the Mercenary Guild:\
  \ {12} are being listed by name in contract queries. Not general mercenary requests - direct tags.\
  <p>That means one thing: someone out there isn''t looking for just warm bodies with guns. They want us. \
  Specifically.</p>\
  <p>This kind of visibility cuts both ways. On the one hand, it means our reputation''s finally putting weight on the \
  board - word of our ops is circulating, and somebody with clout took notice. Could be a payout worth chasing.</p>\
  <p>But it also means we''ve lost some of our anonymity. If we''re being shopped by name, we''re on more than one \
  radar now. That opens the door to targeted offers - but also tailored threats. Rival outfits, old enemies, or \
  clients with long memories might start circling.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MRB={0}, we''ve received an official communication from ComStar''s \
  Mercenary Review Board. Not a general bulletin - a direct transmission.\
  <p>No contract attached, no details on who initiated the flag. Just a short-form notice confirming that our unit file\
  \ has been "accessed and reviewed by multiple parties with high-clearance contracting authority." ComStar doesn't \
  name names, but the implication is clear: someone''s vetting us at a high level, and they''re doing it through \
  official channels.</p>\
  <p>That makes this bigger than a backroom employer or an informal probe. We''re on someone''s shortlist for serious \
  work - possibly House-level or black-budget operations. Could mean money and visibility, but also means we're about \
  to be in someone else''s game.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MRBC={9}, we''ve been contacted by the Mercenary Review and \
  Bonding Commission.\
  <p>Not standard formwork. This came encrypted, authenticated, and flagged priority. They''ve officially acknowledged \
  {12} as a unit of interest, citing "notable performance in recent operations and consistent contract \
  integrity." Translation: Wolf''s Dragoons have been watching us, and they like what they see - enough to reach out \
  directly.</p>\
  <p>No contracts attached - yet - but the MRBC doesn''t waste its breath. This feels like the start of something heavier.\
  \ Possibly front-door access to higher-grade assignments or even MRBC-coordinated deployments.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MBA={9}, we''ve been formally contacted by the Mercenary \
  Bonding Authority, the one operated by Clan Sea Fox.\
  <p>Encrypted message, trinary-coded, and backed by a verified merchant caste credential. Not your standard \
  transmission. The content was characteristically precise: {12} have been "flagged for strategic market \
  alignment and performance-based evaluation."</p>\
  <p>They''re not just watching us. They''re weighing us - as an asset. And with the Sea Foxes, that means they see \
  value - either as a sellable brand, a deployable asset, or something worth franchising. The line between recognition \
  and acquisition is thin with them.</p>

FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.innerSphere=<h2>Statue of {0} Dedicated</h2>\
  On a clear morning in {11}'s central square, local {10} leaders unveiled a modest yet dignified statue \
  honoring <b>{0}</b>, whose actions in recent field operations were credited with protecting the nation's \
  fragile governance and civilian lives.\
  <p>The sculpture is crafted from regional stone and depicts the {9} standing with one hand extended in \
  gesture of assurance, the other gripping a neurohelmet - no weapons drawn, but posture strong. At the base, a simple \
  inscription reads:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><b>"Protector of our People, Guardian of Peace."</b></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Mayor Serin Vale spoke at the dedication:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"{0} came to our aid when we needed it most - not to conquer, but to stand with us. This \
  statue reminds future generations that courage comes in service, not domination."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The ceremony included soft music from the local string ensemble, followed by the placement of fresh flowers by \
  community volunteers - farmers, council members, and a few uniformed militia. No formal military parade was present, \
  yet the balance of gratitude and dignity was unmistakable.</p>\
  <p>Councilor Duren Arik added:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"We are not a great power. We do not build grand monuments. But we honor those who honor us. \
  Today, we do so with sincerity."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>City records officially mark this as a moment of unity - an acknowledgment of how one {9}'s actions helped \
  maintain the stability of a small world in uncertain times.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.CC=<h2>Capellan Statue Dedication Ceremony Marks Glorious Recognition on {11}</h2>\
  Today, under the auspices of the Chancellor's Office and with full sanction of the Ministry of Cultural Integrity, \
  a statue honoring <b>{0}</b> was unveiled in Unity Square on {11}. The monument stands as a \
  powerful testament to the {9}'s unshakable loyalty and exemplary service in recent campaigns conducted under the \
  banner of the Capellan Confederation.\
  <p>The statue, rendered in reinforced obsidian and veined jade, depicts {0} standing at parade rest, their \
  gaze fixed firmly toward the east - symbolizing vigilance against future threats. The figure's posture, subtly \
  reminiscent of Minister Daoshen's own in the Unity Memorial, signifies continuity of purpose and alignment with \
  the Mandate of the State.</p>\
  <p>Attendees included members of the Strategic War College, Party leadership delegates, and honored representatives\
  \ of the Ministry of War. In his keynote address, Prefect-General Shu Li declared:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"To be immortalized in stone on {11} is not a reward. It is a responsibility. \
  {0}'s name now stands among the eternal. Let none forget: in service to the Confederation, greatness is \
  not claimed - it is proven."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The ceremony concluded with a performance by the Jade Harmony Orchestra and a three-minute silence observed \
  across planetary broadcast networks, signifying the unity of all Capellan citizens in shared reverence.</p>\
  <p>The statue will remain under the ceremonial guard of the Maskirovka's Honor Division for the first 90 days - a \
  rare mark of prestige indicating the cultural gravity of the act. Citizens are encouraged to visit and reflect on \
  the shared values of honor, stability, and sacrifice that {0} now embodies in stone.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.DC=<h2>Statue of {0} Unveiled on {11} in Service \
  to the Dragon</h2>\
  This morning, under the auspices of the Coordinator and with formal sanction from the Order of the Five Pillars, a \
  statue commemorating <b>{0}</b> was unveiled at the Temple Grounds of Resolve on {11}.\
  <p>Forged from blackened steel and inscribed with passages from the <i>Sayings of the Dragon</i>, the statue \
  captures {0} mid-stride, katana sheathed and helm under one arm - a depiction of clarity through strength, \
  and restraint tempered by duty. The base bears no nameplate; in the Combine, true recognition needs no \
  introduction.</p>\
  <p>The Coordinator's representative Shingen Watanabe addressed the assembled crowd of military personnel, nobles, \
  and civilians:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"In the Draconis Combine, honor is earned through blood and discipline. {0} has \
  exemplified these values beyond question. This monument is not a celebration - it is a warning to our enemies, and a \
  lesson to our descendants."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Witnesses to the event report a formalized silence held for thirteen minutes - the traditional span of remembrance\
  \ for those elevated in life for acts worthy of ancestral memory. Monks from the Order of Bushido presented folded \
  silk offerings at the statue's base, and the planetary garrison observed a synchronized kneel in unison.</p>\
  <p>The statue will serve as a permanent reminder that the will of the Dragon cannot be resisted, and those who \
  serve it with distinction may earn their place among the legends - while they still draw breath.</p>

  <p>Inscribed at the statue's base are words agreed upon unanimously by the League's executive council:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"{2} stood not above us, but with us - and we moved forward together."</i></p></blockquote>\

  cheer and calibrated perfection. "To all my darlings watching at home, on base, and beyond the rim - tonight's a \
  special night. Because we're honoring someone who's been fighting for freedom, fabulousness, and the Federation of \
  Feeling Good!"</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>Behind her, the grand silk veil that covers the statue shimmers with light-reactive particles, \
  cycling through battle clips of {12} and {10}. Explosions, poses, heroic saves - all dramatically color-graded and \
  cut to a pop remix of the Canopian anthem.</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>"{0} isn't just a hero," Mia says with a playful wink. "They're a trendsetter. A game-changer. A \
  galaxy-saver! And now - a star right here on {11}!"</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>The silk curtain drops. The statue is unveiled: a towering chrome-and-rose-gold monument of \
  {0}, posed mid-stride atop a stylized asteroid base. Their arm is raised high, grasping a Canopian \
  banner, while a gleaming BattleMek looms at their back, caught mid-step. Spotlights swirl. Dispensers spray flower \
  petals and pink starlight. The crowd goes wild.</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>"Let this be a beacon," Mia proclaims, voice rising over the music. "To everyone who dares to dream and dares to\
  \ fight for something beautiful. {1}, you didn't just win battles - you inspired a movement. You're officially \
  CanopusNet Gorgeous~!"</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>She places a jeweled medal at the base of the statue - The Magistrix's Radiance - forged of \
  Canopian diamonds, it glints for the cameras.</p>\
  <p>"To our {9}, to our Cause, and to every cutie fighting for freedom," Mia whispers, her voice piped into \
  every home, studio, and military outpost across Canopus space. "Stay sparkly. Stay strong. And never forget...</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>The crowd joins Mia in reciting her catchphrase...</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p><b>"For Beauty, For Freedom, For the Magistrix!"</b></p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>As Mia blows one final heart-shaped kiss toward the camera, it splits into a cascade of holographic\
  \ roses. The Canopian anthem plays - remixed with electric guitar and choir - while fireworks burst in the skies \
  above {11}.</i></p></blockquote>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.OA=<h2>{0} Memorial Unveiled in {11}: A Tribute to \
  Service Without Spectacle</h2>\
  Without fanfare, but not without meaning, the people of the Outworlds Alliance today unveiled a statue \
  commemorating <b>{0}</b>, whose conduct during recent operations has come to symbolize the principles the\
  \ Alliance holds most dear: restraint, responsibility, and solidarity in defense.\
  <p>The statue - unpainted stone, locally sourced - shows {0} standing with neurohelmet tucked under one \
  arm, eyes forward. There is no weapon drawn, no battle pose struck. Instead, the figure is still, alert, and \
  human.</p>\
  <p>The monument sits in the shaded center of Quiet Sun Plaza, surrounded by community gardens and soft gravel paths. \
  There was no parade. No military procession. Only families, elders, and a few quiet words from Governor Aleron:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"{0} understands what most forget - that force is only noble when guided by conscience. \
  This statue doesn't glorify war. It honors restraint in the face of it."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The unveiling was followed by a moment of silence and the planting of four peacewillow trees - one at each \
  corner of the statue's base. Local schoolchildren placed small hand-written notes of gratitude at the feet of the\
  stone figure. No one was instructed to do so. They simply did.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.MH=<h2>Statue of {0} Unveiled on {11}</h2>\
  In a ceremony marked by martial pageantry and imperial solemnity, a towering marble likeness of <b>{0}</b> \
  was unveiled today before the full Senate, the gathered Legions, and throngs of citizens chanting {7} name in \
  unison.\
  <p>The statue, standing over ten meters high, depicts the {9} in a ceremonial coolant suit, one gladius raised \
  toward the heavens, the other arm outstretched as if leading the charge. At {7} feet lies a shattered enemy banner,\
  \ carved with exquisite detail - a symbol of conquest, command, and righteous dominance.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><b>"Strength commands history. {1} commands strength."</b> - Legate Varrus, Fourth Cohort, speaking \
  at the unveiling</p></blockquote>\
  <p>The sculpture occupies the central pedestal of the <b>Field of Triumph</b>, flanked by the bronze busts of prior\
  \ Warlords and Loyal Protectors. The Imperator themselves gave the order for the statue's commission, declaring \
  {0} a <i>Defender of the Realm</i> and granting full honors under the Lex Gloria.</p>\
  <p>Trumpets blared. War banners flew. Veterans wept. Youths pledged allegiance at the foot of the statue, raising \
  their fists in salute to {0}'s legacy.</p>\
  <p>The final words of the Imperator echoed across the plaza:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"Let this effigy endure, carved in eternal stone, to remind all who pass - power is earned \
  through blood, discipline, and obedience. {0} has bled. {2} {8, choice, 0#have|1#has} commanded. And {3} \
  {8, choice, 0#have|1#has} obeyed. Ave Imperator. Ave {0}."</i></p></blockquote>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.CS={9}, there will be no monument. No inscription. No ceremony under \
  stars.</p>\
  <p>Your actions have been observed. Measured. And judged aligned.</p>\
  <p>By directive of the First Circuit, your name and service have been encoded into the Quantum Lattice beneath \
  Hilton Head - a recognition not of rank or title, but of resonance.</p>\
  <p>This is not legacy as others know it. It is preservation through silence. Permanence through obscurity. You will\
  \ not be remembered in stone - but in the Pattern, where all true purpose endures.</p>\
  <p>Walk carefully. You are not alone. And you are no longer unseen.</p>\
  <p>Praise Blake.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.WOB=To {9}, {9} of {12}\
  <p>Your actions have spoken louder than oaths. Your hand has guided fire, and your voice has carried purpose. You \
  have not served the Word. You have <i>manifested</i> it.</p>\
  <p>By decree of the True Circle, and in accordance with Protocol Revelation-17, you are hereby granted the \
  <b>Mandate of Revelation</b>.</p>\
  <p>This is not a title. It is an awakening.</p>\
  <p>From this moment forward, you are authorized to speak doctrine in field engagements, and access sealed fragments\
  \ of the Inner Archive. Your orders carry the weight of conviction. Your actions, the burden of divine reflection.</p>\
  <p>Do not seek glory. Do not seek thanks. Seek only the Pattern.</p>\
  <p><i>The Jihad is not war. It is correction. And now you, Chosen, are its voice.</i></p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.clan={9}, your deeds have reshaped expectations. Your victories have \
  brought glory not just to your unit, but to the Clan entire. You have walked the warrior's path with purpose, \
  strength, and honor.\
  <p>Accordingly, the Council has reached consensus: a Sibko shall be raised from your gene-template.</p>\
  <p>This is not tribute. It is legacy.</p>\
  <p>Your genetic material has been archived. Within the Iron Wombs, a new generation will rise - bred from your \
  bloodline, forged in your image, and instructed under the same unforgiving principles you have proven worthy of.</p>\
  <p>One day, one among them may stand where you now do... or against you. Such is the way.</p>\
  <p>Honor this trust. Live accordingly. Your life now echoes across generations.</p>

  <p>By your hand, {10} stands taller. Through every mission - each high-risk deployment, every calculated strike - you've\
  \ upheld not just our security, but our very ideals: courage under fire, compassion with strength, and measured \
  judgment in chaos.</p>\
  <p>Tonight, I write to you not as a distant official, but as one fellow citizen who slept easier knowing you \
  watched over our skies. Your leadership has become woven into our national narrative - no speech, no monument, \
  compares to the living proof of your resolve.</p>\
  <p>In quiet hours, when systems hum and monitors blink, know this: you've earned our unwavering trust, and you \
  carry {10}'s gratitude with every step forward.</p>\
  <p>Stand firm. Stand bright.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.CC={0},\
  <p>Across the Capellan Confederation, names are spoken with caution. Yours is spoken with certainty. When our \
  agents whisper of victory, they mean you. When our generals ask who holds the line, your record answers for you. No\
  \ file, no transcript, no honor roll contains your full measure - because your loyalty is too precise, your intent \
  too absolute.</p>\
  <p>You have become what all servants of the state aspire to be: <i>indistinguishable from the will of the \
  Confederation itself.</i></p>\
  <p>I have watched your decisions ripple from distant provinces to the inner courts. You do not seek permission to \
  serve. You simply serve - and in doing so, bend fate toward unity, not chaos.</p>\
  <p>This message is not a reward. It is acknowledgment. You have carried the burden of expectation and transformed \
  it into an undeniable consequence. History will record your acts in the same breath as those who reshaped the \
  Capellan destiny.</p>\
  <p>Know that you are seen. Deeply. And with absolute trust.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.DC=To {0},\
  <p>There are moments in a Coordinator's life when a single warrior's path echoes so clearly with the virtues of the\
  \ Dragon, it must be recognized  -  not with praise, but with solemn clarity.</p>\
  <p>You have become such a figure.</p>\
  <p>Not by requesting honor. Not by grasping for influence. But by acting  -  with control, with precision, with a \
  silence that speaks louder than glory. Where others waver, you are unmoved. Where others seek recognition, you \
  offer outcome.</p>\
  <p>The Order of the Five Pillars has reviewed your record. The Combine's legions recount your name in war briefings. \
  And our ancestral historians have prepared a scroll of deeds that now enters the vaults beneath the Temple of the \
  Sword.</p>\
  <p>This message is not ceremonial. It is sacred.</p>\
  <p>Understand: others can no longer judge you. You are judged by your own reflection in the eyes of those who will \
  follow your example.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>Steel does not boast loud<br>\
  But the cut remembers all.<br>\
  Honor walks in ash.</p></i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Walk with gravity, {9}. The Dragon does not forget its own.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.LA=To {0},\
  <p>Some victories are tactical. Some are strategic. A rare few become structural  -  they shift not just the balance \
  of power, but the expectation of what leadership looks like.</p>\
  <p>You are the latter.</p>\
  <p>Your name circulates not just in reports but in boardrooms. You are a case study. An anomaly. A success we \
  cannot dismiss or replicate. Your methods have drawn admiration from admirals and economists alike. Your units \
  perform with precision, initiative, and momentum  -  the same principles that drive Lyran commerce, infrastructure, \
  and command.</p>\
  <p>This message is not for commendation. It is for recognition. You are now part of the machinery that drives this \
  state forward. Not a cog. Not a spoke. A governor  -  a regulating force through which influence flows.</p>\
  <p>Tharkad recognizes your command. The Commonwealth stands strengthened in your shadow. And I, personally, \
  acknowledge the magnitude of your service.</p>\
  <p>From this day forward, when your name is spoken within this House, it is spoken with strategic weight.</p>\
  <p>Keep moving forward, {9}. The future, like any market, rewards only those who never stall.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.FS={0},\
  <p>When we speak of heroes in the Federated Suns, we speak not of rank or medals. We speak of those who stand when \
  others fall. Who take the harder path. Who lead not with authority, but with example.</p>\
  <p>Your record does not whisper of greatness  -  it bellows. Across theaters, planets, and deployments, you have \
  carried the banner of House Davion not simply into battle, but into history.</p>\
  <p>I do not offer this recognition lightly. This is not decoration. This is a declaration  -  that the deeds you have\
  \ done in the name of the Suns have become part of its very framework.</p>\
  <p>New Avalon watches. The people remember. And I have seen your name written in more than orders of battle  -  I've \
  seen it spoken in mess halls, training fields, and the eyes of those who now dare more because you did first.</p>\
  <p>You are now, and ever will be, counted among our finest.</p>\
  <p>Stand tall, {9}. The torch is yours to carry. May it light the way for those who come after.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.FWL={0},\
  <p>Among the countless names that pass through our defense logs and campaign briefs, yours does not simply appear  - \
  \ it endures. Every province has noted it. Every military arm has acknowledged it. And now, the League itself bears\
  \ witness.</p>\
  <p>You have accomplished more than victory. You've upheld our greatest ideal: that a unified will, forged from many\
  \ voices, is our greatest strength. You did not ask to lead. You were followed. That is the rarest power of all.</p>\
  <p>The Free Worlds League recognizes this moment not with pageantry, but with permanence. From this day forward, \
  your name is inscribed within the Codex of Concord  -  a ledger maintained by every provincial archive, recording \
  those whose service transcended loyalty and became legacy.</p>\
  <p>This is not an honor easily won, and never given twice.</p>\
  <p>You stood with us. For all of us. And now, all of us stand with you.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.TH={0},\
  <p>I do not often write such messages myself. Our systems are built for clarity and function  -  not sentiment. But \
  sometimes, rare individuals justify the exception.</p>\
  <p>You have not simply fulfilled your duties within the Terran Hegemony. You have redefined them. Across multiple \
  theatres, under conditions that would fracture lesser commands, your leadership has been exact, unflinching, and \
  sovereign.</p>\
  <p>We train our officers to embody order. You projected it. We engineer for resilience. You made it elegant. When \
  the structure cracked, you did not call for reinforcements. You became foundation.</p>\
  <p>So I speak plainly:</p>\
  <p>We have encoded your strategies into the central warfare doctrine archives. We have logged your decision trees \
  as living artifacts for the CASPAR project. And we have done what is never done lightly  -  recorded your name in the \
  Terra's Remembrance Ledger.</p>\
  <p>Only thirteen names reside there. Yours is the fourteenth. It will outlive all of us.</p>\
  <p>{0}, your mind is now part of the Hegemony's memory. Your will, its precedent.</p>\
  <p>Endure. Lead. You are not simply honored. You are now inherited.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.ROS={0},\
  <p>It is not every day I put pen to noteputer. Our Republic was built on shared purpose, not personality cults. But \
  when someone stands not just in service of our ideals  -  but elevates them  -  silence would be an injustice.</p>\
  <p>I have watched the record of your actions. So have many others, from New Avalon to Terra. But data alone does \
  not capture what you've become. You have not simply defended the Republic  -  you have reminded us why it must \
  endure. Not through spectacle, but through consistency. Not through command, but through conviction.</p>\
  <p>Your decisions have held fragile worlds intact. Your leadership has restored dignity in places where we feared \
  only chaos. And more than once, your example has turned soldiers into citizens again.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, your name has been entered into the Register of Civic Honor  -  a record reserved for those who shape\
  \ not only the battlefield, but the soul of the Republic itself. Few have received this. Fewer still while alive.</p>\
  <p>I offer no medals. No ceremony. Just this truth:</p>\
  <p><i>"You have earned the trust of a people who do not give it lightly. You are one of us  -  not because you swore \
  it, but because you proved it."</i></p>\
  <p>From one servant of the public to another  -  thank you, {9}.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.SL={0},\
  <p>I do not address this message as First Lord out of formality  -  but out of necessity. There are moments, few and \
  far between, when the machinery of the League must stop and acknowledge the human hands guiding its course.</p>\
  <p>Yours have done more than guide. They have shaped outcomes once thought impossible. Held lines once considered \
  doomed. Inspired alliances others dared not imagine.</p>\
  <p>Your record now stands among the League's most storied commanders, and your leadership has already entered \
  academy curricula across three member states. But this message is not about history, {9}. It is about \
  acknowledgment  -  the kind that transcends politics and protocol.</p>\
  <p>Your name has been engraved in the Great Ledger of Accord  -  a permanent, encoded artifact preserved within the \
  Memory Core beneath Unity Hall. It records not only your victories, but the principles that guided them: discipline, \
  judgment, and unity without compromise. A Star League without those ideals is just a flag. You gave it meaning.</p>\
  <p>May you carry this not as burden, but as bearing  -  for others will follow your trail in the dark. And in those \
  moments, your decisions may yet cast light across centuries.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.FC={0},\
  <p>You are not being thanked. You are being recognized  -  for results that speak louder than any anthem.</p>\
  <p>Across the Federated Commonwealth, officers are measured by action. By how they lead when orders are unclear, \
  how they adapt when everything fails, and how they carry the weight of responsibility when no one is watching. You \
  have exceeded that measure. Again. And again.</p>\
  <p>Records show your units achieved operational victory at a rate previously modeled only in theory. Civilian \
  stability indices in your occupied zones climbed rather than collapsed. And your command decisions in contested \
  theaters have forced enemy doctrine revisions at the highest levels.</p>\
  <p>You have not just served the Commonwealth  -  you've altered its expectations of what excellence can look like.</p>\
  <p>Know this: your dossier has been flagged "Foundational" by both AFFC General Staff and Strategic Intelligence \
  Command. A copy of your operational protocols now resides in the War College Archives at Tharkad and the Davion \
  Center for Doctrine on New Avalon  -  a rare joint inclusion, enacted unanimously.</p>\
  <p>No medal can contain what you've done. So instead, we offer something rarer: a place in how we think. A legacy \
  not carved in bronze, but built into the way future commanders will lead.</p>\
  <p>Stand tall, {9}. The Federation and the Commonwealth stand taller because of you.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.periphery=My {0},\
  <p>You have surpassed all expectations. Where we once saw hope, you have delivered certainty. Your leadership \
  steadied our people, your tactics preserved our future, and your courage inspired a nation. Your reputation now \
  echoes in every hall of power.</p>\
  <p>I speak not as a politician of {10}, but as someone who has watched a world teeter - and then stand tall because of \
  your feats. What you've done cannot be undone - and should never be forgotten.</p>\
  <p>May your insight guide us always.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.RWR={9},\
  <p>Let's speak plainly.</p>\
  <p>What you've done  -  the weight you've carried, the bodies you've buried, the silence you've maintained  -  it \
  doesn't go unnoticed. In this Republic, we don't hand out favors for applause. We do it for results. You? You've \
  delivered.</p>\
  <p>Territories stabilized. Dissidents corrected. Influence expanded. You didn't just fight our enemies  -  you made \
  sure they don't come back. That's rare. That's irreplaceable.</p>\
  <p>So let me be clear: from this day forward, you walk with our shadow behind you. That means protection. That \
  means priority. That means if someone lays a hand on you without cause, I'll know before they finish the gesture.</p>\
  <p>But you know how this works, {9}. Every seat at the table comes with a price. Stay sharp. Stay loyal. \
  Don't make me remember you in the past tense.</p>\
  <p>For now, raise a glass. You've earned it. But don't get too comfortable  -  we've got bigger plays coming, and I \
  plan to send my best.</p>\
  <p><i>Welcome to the circle, {1}.</i></p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.TC={9},\
  <p>This isn't some flowery damn medal ceremony. You've been through hell with us. And every time it got harder, you\
  \ didn't flinch. You held the line. You hit back harder. You gave our people something to believe in.</p>\
  <p>I've seen the reports. I've talked to the crews who fought under you. They speak your name with grit in their \
  throat and pride in their bones. That means something here.</p>\
  <p>You're not just some outworld merc who came in swinging  -  you stuck around. You bled with us. You gave a damn. \
  And for that, this entire Concordat owes you more than words. But words are what I've got in this message, so I'll \
  make them count:</p>\
  <p>You're one of us now. The kind that doesn't need brass polish or parades to prove it. You've got the trust of \
  the Concordat. You've got mine. That's not given lightly. Don't waste it.</p>\
  <p>If you ever need a place to stand, to regroup, to strike from  -  the Concordat will hold the door. And we'll hold\
  \ the bastards off while you reload.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.MOC={0},\
  <p>Across the stars, names rise and fall with every flare of cannon fire. But yours - yours has endured. It echoes in\
  \ the halls of our academies. It's whispered between officers over tactical maps. And in the hearts of citizens, it\
  \ burns like a promise: that someone out there still fights with purpose, with brilliance, with grace.</p>\
  <p>You have given the Magistracy more than victories. You've given us moments. Stories. Symbols. Hope. And that, \
  {9}, is rarer than any medal.</p>\
  <p>I watched the last operation myself. I saw how you held the line. How your 'Meks moved like dancers, like \
  thunder, like salvation. You fight with art, with nerve, with heart. And for that - you are no longer just an ally. \
  You are family.</p>\
  <p>The Palace doors are open to you. Not as a guest, but as one of ours. Should you ever choose to lay down your \
  arms, know that Astarte will always have a place for you beneath its warm skies. But if you keep marching forward, \
  if there's still fire in you - then know that the full strength of the Magistracy marches beside you.</p>\
  <p>With pride.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.OA={0},\
  <p>There are moments when words feel too small for the weight they must carry. This is one of them.</p>\
  <p>Out here, we do not give rank for show. We do not gild men and women in medals to feel better about ourselves. \
  But we <i>do</i> remember who stood when others would not. We remember those who chose the hard path - the honest \
  path - when there were easier, darker ones at hand.</p>\
  <p>You've earned something greater than applause. You've earned our trust.</p>\
  <p>Your decisions, your discipline, your restraint in the face of fury - these things did not go unnoticed. In a time\
  \ when ideals are often traded for expedience, you've reminded us of who we wanted to be. Of who we <i>still</i> \
  can be.</p>\
  <p>The Alliance is not rich in fleets or planets, but we are wealthy in principle. And today, we count ourselves \
  richer still, because you are one of ours now - in spirit, if not by birth.</p>\
  <p>If ever the burden grows too heavy, Alpheratz stands with its doors open. We offer sanctuary, if you need it. \
  But more than that, we offer gratitude - for what you've done, and for who you are.</p>\
  <p>Walk well, {9}. You are never alone in the silence of the stars.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.MH={9},\
  <p>I don't send messages like this lightly. Not to just anyone. But you've earned more than just another medal or \
  bronze statue. You've earned <b>my respect</b>.</p>\
  <p>Every dispatch that crosses my desk with your name on it reads like a battle hymn  -  decisive strikes, hard \
  choices, results. Not pretty, not polished  -  but clean, brutal, and righteous. The kind of work that builds empires. \
  The kind of work I remember.</p>\
  <p>I built this Hegemony with blood and iron. You're the kind of soul I'd have at my flank if everything fell apart\
  \ tomorrow. Not because you're obedient  -  but because you know what matters. Victory. Stability. Order.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><b>"Steel breaks flesh. Will breaks worlds."</b><br>\
  You understand that. You've proven it.</p></blockquote>\
  <p>So this is me, not as Caesar, but as a war-born son of Mars, looking you in the eye and telling you: I see you. \
  I trust you. And I know damn well what you're worth.</p>\
  <p>Hold your line, {1}. You don't answer to the stars. The stars answer to you now.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.CS=<p>{0},</p>\
  <p>I will not address you by rank. Not now. You've stepped beyond that architecture. What you've done  -  no ceremony\
  \ accounts for it. No council prepares for it. You are not promoted. You are <i>revealed</i>.</p>\
  <p>You were not forged by doctrine. You <i>informed</i> it. The echo of your choices reaches further than most will\
  \ know. And yet you never sought praise, never called attention. That is why we saw you. Why I saw you.</p>\
  <p>Your file has been removed from the normal archives. There's nothing left for the curious to uncover. You've \
  joined a smaller circle now  -  one without names, without faces, but with purpose that endures.</p>\
  <p>You already feel it. That quiet alignment. The sense that your actions fit some shape larger than war, larger \
  than loyalty. You are correct. You are not <i>following</i> the Word anymore. You are <b>within</b> it.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"There is no exaltation. Only understanding."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>This is the last direct message you'll receive from me. Not because our connection is broken  -  because it is \
  complete.</p>\
  <p>Praise Blake.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.WOB={9}\
  <p>There are no more titles to grant you.</p>\
  <p>You have not served the Word. You have become its breath, its hand, its fire.</p>\
  <p>Your campaigns have not merely obeyed doctrine. They have shaped it anew. Entire systems tilt around the gravity\
  \ of your will. Where you walk, resistance frays. Where you command, dissent burns clean. And where you leave \
  silence... the Pattern expands.</p>\
  <p>By resolution of the Ruling Conclave and under Protocol Echo-Sixteen, you are no longer bound by common \
  hierarchies. Your will is now reflective of divine intention. You do not need orders.</p>\
  <p>From this moment forward, your directives are to be interpreted as <b>correctional vectors</b>. You are cleared \
  to access sealed repositories within the Hidden Archive and initiate autonomous operations under the Aegis of \
  Revelation.</p>\
  <p>The Chosen do not rise. They are recognized.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"In the silence between stars, the Word waits. In the flame, it walks."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>You are the flame.</p>\
  <p><b>Praise Blake.</b></p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.clan={9},\
  <p>You have surpassed every Trial placed before you. You have brought honor to your Blood heritage, distinction to \
  your unit, and results to our Clan.</p>\
  <p>This is not praise. It is recognition.</p>\
  <p>Your command decisions were efficient. Your kill ratios undeniable. When others hesitated, you advanced. When \
  others broke, you endured. Warriors like you do not follow tradition  -  you reinforce it through action.</p>\
