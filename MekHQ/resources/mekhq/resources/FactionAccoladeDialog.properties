FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.innerSphere={0}, our unit''s been flagged in recent data requests \
  traced back to {2}''s internal military and administrative systems. From what I can tell, this is tied directly to \
  our support operations in the region.\
  <p>They''re impressed. We''ve earned a reputation within as a dependable and capable presence, and it looks like \
  their command structure is starting to take us seriously.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep the pressure steady and the results clean. They could become a useful ally - or at the very least, a \
  friendly DropPort.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.CC={0}, our unit has shown up in several high-level search logs \
  from within the Confederation''s military command structure. It''s clear we''ve attracted attention from above.\
  <p>That could mean opportunity - or increased scrutiny. Either way, we need to stay sharp and keep our record clean. \
  The Chancellor doesn''t watch casually.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.DC={0}, our unit has been flagged in recent data pulls \
  originating from Combine High Command. We are being observed.\
  <p>This is not unexpected, given our recent record. Recognition from above is earned - but it also brings increased \
  expectations. The Dragon does not reward lightly, nor forgive failure.</p>\
  <p>I recommend we operate with absolute precision. Now is the time to prove we are worthy of the attention we''ve \
  drawn.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.LA={0}, I ran a routine systems check and found that our unit''s \
  name has come up in several flagged searches from LCAF senior staff. We''ve clearly landed on someone''s radar.\
  <p>Given our recent performance, I''d say this is the start of something bigger - assignments, evaluations, maybe even \
  patronage. Of course, it also means we''ll be under closer scrutiny.</p>\
  <p>Let''s make sure what they see keeps us moving up, not sideways.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FS={0}, our unit has been flagged in recent searches coming out \
  of Federated Suns High Command. It looks like we''ve drawn attention from above.\
  <p>Given how we''ve been performing, it''s not a surprise - but it is a responsibility. They''re watching now, and that \
  means every move counts more than ever.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep showing them that their trust - or curiosity - is well-placed.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FWL={0}, I''ve reviewed recent network activity, and our unit has \
  been flagged in multiple search queries from different branches of League command. We''re on the radar now - possibly \
  in more than one bloc.\
  <p>That could open doors, or it could mean someone''s sizing us up. Either way, we should stay sharp and keep our \
  profile clean. In the League, attention from above can shift quickly - best we guide it, not chase it.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.TH={0}, our unit has been flagged in multiple high-clearance \
  search protocols traced back to Hegemony Command. We''re officially on their watchlist - likely under performance review.\
  <p>This isn''t cause for concern - yet. It''s a signal that our actions are aligning with greater strategic interests. In\
  \ the Hegemony, recognition from above often precedes increased expectations.</p>\
  <p>Let''s ensure we continue to operate in a way that honors the legacy we represent.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.ROS={0}, our unit has been flagged in recent search activity \
  originating from upper echelons of Republic Command. We''re clearly under review - most likely due to our recent field\
  \ performance.\
  <p>This kind of attention could lead to expanded responsibilities. It also means we''ll be held to a higher standard \
  from here on out.</p>\
  <p>Let''s make sure we continue to reflect the values this Republic was built on - stability, integrity, and trust.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.SL={0}, our unit has been flagged in multiple search queries \
  issued by central Star League command. We appear to be under observation by higher strategic authorities.\
  <p>This likely reflects our operational record to date - and signals that we may be considered for more critical \
  assignments. The League does not act without purpose.</p>\
  <p>Let''s ensure that everything we do from this point forward upholds the ideals we serve: unity, order, and the \
  preservation of peace.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FC={0}, our unit has been flagged in recent data pulls from the \
  Federated Commonwealth''s joint command systems. We''ve drawn the eye of higher leadership - likely in recognition of \
  our recent actions.\
  <p>That kind of visibility comes with opportunity - and scrutiny. Let''s stay focused and disciplined. If we''re being \
  watched, let''s give them something worth backing.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.periphery={0}, we''ve been flagged in a string of intel queries \
  coming from inside {2} - government channels, militia databases, even administrative logs. From the look of it, word \
  of our recent actions on their behalf is spreading fast.\
  <p>They''re watching us now, not as a threat, but as an asset. A force that gets results.</p>\
  <p>Might be worth leaning into that. Relationships like this don''t happen often out here - and when they do, they \
  can pay off in ways C-Bills can''t.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.RWR={0}, our unit has appeared in recent search activity \
  originating from Rim Worlds central authority. We''ve drawn attention from the upper chain - possibly the Directorate \
  itself.\
  <p>This could mean recognition. It could also mean evaluation. Either way, we continue forward with \
  discipline and absolute alignment to the Republic''s vision.</p>\
  <p>Stay sharp. In the Republic, attention is never neutral.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.TC={0}, our unit''s been flagged in recent searches by senior \
  Concordat defense officials. Word''s gotten around - we''ve made an impression.\
  <p>That kind of attention can mean trust, or testing. Either way, it''s on us to show we''re worth the faith. Let''s \
  keep doing what we''ve been doing - clean, solid work that speaks louder than promises ever could.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MOC={0}, our unit has been flagged in recent strategic reviews \
  coming out of Magistracy high command. It''s clear we''ve attracted some attention - likely due to our recent \
  effectiveness.\
  <p>This kind of visibility tends to lead somewhere - contracts, evaluations, or possibly an invitation. Let''s make \
  sure what they see reinforces the value we bring to the Crown.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.OA={0}, our unit has been flagged in recent inquiry records from \
  Outworlds Alliance command. We''ve drawn some attention - likely from the Council''s strategic oversight division.\
  <p>It''s not something they do lightly. That kind of interest means they''re watching what we''re building out here - and \
  weighing what more we could take on.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep our operations clean, precise, and true to the Alliance''s values. We didn''t ask for this attention, \
  but we''ve earned it.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MH={0}, our unit has been flagged in recent data sweeps from \
  upper-tier command in the Marian Hegemony. Word is, someone close to the Caesar''s circle is watching.\
  <p>This isn''t the kind of attention we can afford to waste. Recognition here means expectation - of strength, of \
  discipline, of results. Let''s give them exactly that.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.TD={0}, our unit''s been flagged in search logs across several \
  local planetary militias and governor''s offices. Looks like word of what we''ve done for the Totuga Dominions is \
  spreading.\
  <p>Make no mistake - they''re not curious. They''re scared. Afraid we''ll show up next, kick in the doors, and take \
  whatever''s not bolted down.</p>\
  <p>I say let ''em sweat. Fear''s just respect waiting to happen.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.CS={0}, our unit has been referenced in several flagged \
  information queries originating from within ComStar. The nature of the searches was...specific, and they weren''t \
  routed through public channels.\
  <p>This isn''t casual interest. The Order is aware of us - and watching.</p>\
  <p>We should proceed with caution. When ComStar looks too closely, it''s rarely just to admire the work.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.WOB={0}, our unit has appeared in recent searches traced back to \
  Word of Blake enclaves - specifically the inner doctrinal networks. The kind they don''t access without purpose.\
  <p>It''s not praise. It''s prophecy. They believe we''ve aligned with the Pattern... or that we might disrupt it.</p>\
  <p>Either way, the True Believers are looking at us now. Best we stay sharp, stay moving, and remember - attention \
  from the Word rarely ends with just observation.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.clan={0}, our unit has been marked in recent internal Watch \
  searches - originating from senior {2} command. They are watching us.\
  <p>This is not flattery. It is evaluation. Attention in the Clans is never casual - it is earned or it is provoked.</p>\
  <p>We must continue to operate with strength, clarity, and discipline. If they are measuring us, then let them find \
  proof of worth, not weakness.</p>

FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.innerSphere=<h2>{1} Secure Borders</h2>\
  The Ministry of Defense has confirmed the successful conclusion of a joint operations contract with the military \
  command known as {1}, led by {0}. The operation focused on stabilizing contested zones in border territories and \
  restoring control to government forces.\
  <p>{1} were contracted under emergency authority following a sharp increase in coordinated insurgent \
  activity. Over the course of several weeks, their unit engaged in rapid deployment actions, cleared key supply \
  routes, and neutralized several high-value targets.</p>\
  <p>"This was a strategic decision, not a political one," said {2} Minister of Defense Taren Voss. "Our own \
  forces were stretched. {1} had the skill and the will to respond quickly - and they delivered."</p>\
  <p>While some in the Assembly questioned the optics of relying on military adventurism, recent polling suggests \
  public opinion leans in favor of the operation, especially in provinces directly affected by the conflict.</p>\
  <p>{0} declined formal interviews, but was described by field officers as "focused, efficient, and \
  respectful of command hierarchy."</p>\
  <p>As debates continue over the future role of the military in national defense, few deny that this intervention \
  worked - and for now, {1} stand as proof that performance speaks louder than politics.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.CC=<h2>Capellan Command Praises {1}</h2>\
  In recent weeks, the military unit known as {1}, \
  operating, under contract with the Capellan Confederation Armed Forces (CCAF), has executed a series of strategic \
  operations that reflect both exceptional capability and ideological alignment with the principles of the State.\
  <p>Under the command of {0}, a tactician noted for discipline and discretion, {1} have \
  successfully neutralized hostile elements near contested regions while supporting civil infrastructure recovery \
  across multiple worlds under Confederation protection.</p>\
  <p>Military sources confirm that {1}'' conduct has garnered attention from senior elements within the \
  War College of Liao and the Ministry of Military Affairs. "Their performance has demonstrated not just competence, \
  but clarity of purpose," said one source speaking on condition of authorization. "They understand the value of \
  order."</p>\
  <p>Citizens are reminded that the Confederation welcomes those who serve with loyalty and uphold the dignity of the\
  \ Capellan cause. For now, {0} and their {1} appear to be doing exactly that.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.DC=<h2>Service to the Dragon Noted</h2>\
  The military unit known as {1}, under the \
  leadership of {0}, has recently completed a series of operations in service to the Draconis Combine. \
  These operations, sanctioned by regional DCMS command, have advanced local stability and reflected favorably on the\
  \ unit''s conduct.\
  <p>{1} have so far comported themselves with the restraint and precision expected of those who serve \
  under the Dragon''s banner. Field reports confirm they executed orders efficiently, sustaining minimal civilian \
  disruption.</p>\
  <p>High Command has declined public comment, but sources within the Internal Security Force noted the unit has \
  "acted with appropriate discipline and operational clarity." Whether further operational opportunities will be \
  extended remains at the discretion of the Coordinator''s military advisors.</p>\
  <p>Citizens are reminded that honor is revealed through service.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.LA=<h2>LCAF Acknowledges {1}</h2>\
  The Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces confirmed today that \
  {1}, a high-performing combat unit led by {0}, have completed several successful operations \
  in partnership with regional LCAF command.\
  <p>Operating in contested space, {1} demonstrated tactical effectiveness, logistical discipline, and a\
  \ professionalism that has drawn the attention of senior officers. Analysts noted their use of heavy firepower and \
  measured engagement strategies align well with established Lyran doctrine.</p>\
  <p>"I''ve worked with plenty of commands," said General Annika Rist, "But few show the kind of battlefield economy \
  and results-focused mindset we''ve seen from {0}''s unit."</p>\
  <p>Speculation is already circulating about longer-term operations or asset integration opportunities should \
  {1} continue to meet performance benchmarks.</p>\
  <p>As the Commonwealth continues to stabilize key borders and defend its economic interests, proven allies are \
  always welcome.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.FS=<h2>{1} Earn Suns' Trust</h2>\
  Under the capable command of {0}, {1} have \
  made headlines following their recent support operations. Deployed with the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns \
  (AFFS), the unit executed coordinated strikes against destabilizing elements.\
  <p>{1} have conducted themselves with professionalism and evident loyalty to the ideals of the Suns. \
  Their actions earned commendations from regional high command and, according to insiders, may place them on a short\
  \ list for higher-priority deployments.</p>\
  <p>"{0}''s team has shown a clear commitment to protecting our citizens and preserving stability in the \
  region," said Colonel Thomas Halley of the 17th Avalon Hussars. "They may wear a different patch, but they fight \
  like one of us."</p>\
  <p>The Federated Suns has a long tradition of helping to develop commands that become household names - and \
  {1} appear well on their way to becoming a trusted name in that legacy.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.FWL=<h2>League Commends {1}</h2>\
  {1}, under the command of {0}, has \
  recently concluded a string of successful operations in the League''s outer provinces, earning attention from \
  multiple regional defense authorities.\
  <p>Operating under a League-sanctioned operation planned by the Ministry of Defense, {1} have \
  contributed to stabilization efforts along the tumultuous border zones. According to sources close to provincial \
  command channels, the unit''s performance has exceeded expectations in terms of both tactical output and political \
  restraint.</p>\
  <p>While formal statements remain guarded, an aide to a Marik bloc general - speaking anonymously - described the unit \
  as "a reliable partner with enough independence to be useful and enough discipline to avoid causing waves."</p>\
  <p>Though inter-bloc coordination remains a constant balancing act, the presence of a competent, apolitical force \
  like {1} may offer useful flexibility in future operations.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.TH=<h2>Terra Recognizes {1}</h2>\
  In a formal bulletin issued today by the Hegemony Central Security\
  \ Directorate, {1}, led by {0}, have been acknowledged for their role in resolving a \
  volatile military concern in an unnamed border region.\
  <p>Operating under classified terms with Terran High Command oversight, {1} executed several precision \
  operations supporting civilian evacuation, infrastructure defense, and interdiction of rogue elements threatening \
  Hegemony protectorate space.</p>\
  <p>The unit''s professionalism and operational restraint have drawn attention from the Ministry of Strategic \
  Planning. "{0} leads with discipline and a clear understanding of the principles that built Terra," said \
  an internal source familiar with the situation.</p>\
  <p>Analysts note this marks a rare instance of public acknowledgment from Terran High Command - an indication of both\
  \ growing trust and the weight of expectation.</p>\
  <p>As always, the Hegemony recognizes those who act not merely with power, but with purpose.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.ROS=<h2>Republic Lauds Unit?s Efforts</h2>\
  In a briefing earlier this week, Republic Command acknowledged \
  the contributions of {1}, led by {0}, for their role in reinforcing stability across \
  multiple contested systems.\
  <p>Deployed as part of a civilian-support operation, {1} provided critical assistance during \
  infrastructure recovery and repelled multiple incursions in the border zones. Their timely actions prevented \
  widespread damage to Republic commerce and civilian networks, according to the Ministry of Strategic Security.</p>\
  <p>"{0} and their unit has consistently operated with professionalism, discipline, and alignment with our \
  civic values," said Command Liaison Director Hiram Dukas. "They''ve proven themselves more than just \
  MekWarriors - they''ve acted as partners in protection."</p>\
  <p>This recognition marks a rare commendation for an auxiliary unit, a move some analysts interpret as a signal of \
  expanding flexibility in the Republic''s defense doctrine.</p>\
  <p>As the Republic continues to prioritize stability and cooperative reconstruction, forces like {1} \
  stand as proof that action defines loyalty.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.SL=<h2>Star League Commends Action</h2>\
  In a statement released today by the Office of Central Command \
  Oversight, the Star League Defense Force formally recognized {1}, under the command of {0}, \
  for their contributions to recent stability operations.\
  <p>{1} were instrumental in repelling insurgent activity, executing rapid-response strikes against \
  destabilizing forces while providing humanitarian security for Star League-aligned settlements.</p>\
  <p>"{0}''s team operated with the kind of precision and restraint we expect from League forces," said \
  General Carissa Thorne, senior SLDF logistics coordinator. "They understood the responsibility that comes with \
  power - and exercised it in the League''s best interest."</p>\
  <p>As the Star League continues its mission to unify and preserve, such operations play a vital role in securing \
  peace in our time.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.FC=<h2>Commonwealth Trusts {1}</h2>\
  In a joint statement from regional military offices, the Federated\
  \ Commonwealth has commended {1}, led by {0}, for their critical role in stabilizing \
  a number of volatile systems.\
  <p>Operating alongside Commonwealth forces on a multi-phase deployment, {1} provided tactical \
  reinforcement, interdiction support, and civilian protection during a series of fast-moving engagements. Military \
  officials cited the unit''s adaptability, professionalism, and consistent alignment with Commonwealth command \
  protocols.</p>\
  <p>"{0} leads from the front, and their unit operates with the kind of discipline and decisiveness we \
  expect from our own," said General Alaric Voight of the 3rd Royal Guards. "They''ve earned more than just a \
  medal - they''ve earned our trust."</p>\
  <p>A source close to the matter has commented that {1} are now being evaluated for continued high-level \
  operations and extended strategic partnerships may be on the table.</p>\
  <p>In a time when strength and cohesion are more important than ever, {1} stand as a sharp example of \
  what loyalty, skill, and action can accomplish.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.periphery=<h2>{2} Praises Defense Work</h2>\
  Local authorities have issued a formal statement of \
  appreciation to the military unit known as {1}, led by {0}, for their successful \
  intervention in suppressing a recent wave of insurgent activity across several rural districts.\
  <p>{1}, operating under a short-term defense contract approved by the central council, conducted \
  targeted operations against armed criminal elements believed to be operating from outside {2}''s official \
  borders. Civilian casualties were minimal, and infrastructure damage was described as "within acceptable \
  parameters."</p>\
  <p>"They came when we needed help, not promises," said Deputy Marshal Alen Varn. "They didn''t lecture us. They \
  fought."</p>\
  <p>While large forces operating in Periphery territory often face scrutiny, early reports suggest {1} \
  maintained full transparency with regional command and observed local sovereignty throughout their deployment.</p>\
  <p>For a government stretched thin by unrest, this rare display of cooperation with planetary defense has sparked \
  cautious optimism.</p>\
  <p>"We''re not in the habit of handing out medals," said Councilor Jada Kreel, "but {1} earned my \
  thanks. That doesn''t happen often."</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.RWR=<h2>Rim Worlds Applaud Results</h2>\
  The Central Directorate has formally acknowledged the battlefield\
  \ contributions of {1}, an auxiliary unit under the command of {0}, for recent operations \
  carried out under supervision of the Republican Guard.\
  <p>Tasked with containment and eradication of dissident activity, {1} executed assigned objectives \
  with efficiency and minimal deviation from approved parameters. Their actions have - temporarily - demonstrated \
  alignment with the state''s vision for enforced order and external stability.</p>\
  <p>"Operational results are what matter," said a Directorate analyst overseeing asset utilization. "{0}''s\
  \ unit delivered. That is sufficient for now."</p>\
  <p>Sources confirm the unit is under continued observation. Additional deployments may be considered based on \
  performance, obedience, and ideological compatibility.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.TC=<h2>Concordat Commends Discipline</h2>\
  The Office of the Protectorate Defense Command has issued a public\
  \ commendation to {1}, a unit operating under {0}, for their support in securing Concordat \
  territories.\
  <p>Tasked with vital operations and civilian defense across several vulnerable settlements, {1}\
  \ demonstrated discipline, tactical restraint, and a clear respect for Taurian sovereignty.</p>\
  <p>"They came in, did the job right, and didn''t overreach," said Colonel Deric Mahon of the Concordat Defense \
  Force. "They weren''t here to show off - they were here to help. That counts for something."</p>\
  <p>While newer combat units often face scrutiny, {0}''s team has begun to shift perception. There is \
  already talk within the Concordat Assembly of drafting new terms for cooperative defense efforts based on this \
  successful engagement.</p>\
  <p>Here in the Concordat, loyalty is earned - and {1} may be on their way to earning more than just a \
  contract.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.MOC=<h2>The Magistrix''s New Heroes</h2>\
  The Magistracy Armed Forces confirmed today that \
  {1}, led by {0}, have completed a series of coordinated operations in Magistracy space with \
  distinction.\
  <p>{1} worked in conjunction with MAF strategic command and civilian security coalitions to neutralize\
  \ multiple hostile threats while maintaining strong support for infrastructure recovery and local governance.</p>\
  <p>Their professionalism and discretion have not gone unnoticed.</p>\
  <p>"We judge a by how they act," said Colonel Lysandra Vo, MAF liaison to the Office of External Defense. \
  "{0}''s team understood the assignment and exceeded expectations."</p>\
  <p>While formal partnerships remain rare, insiders suggest {1} may be approached for future \
  collaborative contracts - particularly those requiring a precise touch.</p>\
  <p>In the Magistracy, reputation isn''t granted - it''s earned. And {1} are building theirs one clean \
  operation at a time.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.OA=<h2>Alliance Acknowledges Support</h2>\
  The Council of Prefectural Security has issued an official \
  commendation to {1}, a command unit under the leadership of {0}, following a series of \
  coordinated defense operations across Alliance territory.\
  <p>Operating under provisional oversight in the outer prefectures, {1} assisted in securing civilian \
  transports and provided non-intrusive support to local militia forces without compromising regional autonomy - an \
  achievement that has earned them quiet respect among senior Council members.</p>\
  <p>"They did the work. They didn''t overstep. They listened," said Prefect Ilana Wys, commander of the Alliance \
  Border Militia. "That''s rare."</p>\
  <p>Though the Outworlds Alliance historically favors internal defense and limited military presence, \
  {0}''s approach - calm, efficient, and unobtrusive - has sparked new conversations around selective \
  deployments of trusted units.</p>\
  <p>In a region where peace is hard-won and sovereignty is non-negotiable, {1} have proven that military \
  help doesn''t have to come at the cost of control.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.MH=<h2>Marian Praise for {1}</h2>\
  Imperial Command has confirmed that {1}, a military \
  unit under the leadership of {0}, have earned formal praise from the Legio Marianes following a \
  victorious campaign on the Hegemony frontier.\
  <p>Engaged in operations to enforce Hegemony rule in contested territories, {1} were granted limited \
  command authority by regional Legates - and delivered results with speed, discipline, and power.</p>\
  <p>Sources within the Caesar''s court indicate that the unit''s performance was reviewed personally, with \
  commendations issued under the imperial seal.</p>\
  <p>"They acted without hesitation. They achieved results without excuses," said Tribune Flavian Rax, senior aide to\
  \ the Caesar. "Such conduct reflects the values of the Legio."</p>\
  <p>{0}''s name is now spoken with respect in both Senate halls and military camps. Rumors of further \
  operations - or possible honorary titles - are already circulating.</p>\
  <p>In the Marian Hegemony, strength is currency - and {1} are proving rich in it.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.TD=<h2>{1} Linked to Pirates</h2>\
  Once considered a disciplined command, {1}, led by \
  the enigmatic {0}, are now raising alarms across multiple sectors following their recent involvement with\
  \ the Tortuga Dominions - a known haven for pirates, warlords, and renegade factions.\
  <p>Sources confirm {1} accepted a direct contract from Tortugan leaders earlier this cycle, reportedly \
  conducting "containment" operations that resulted in the razing of several settlements, seizure of trade convoys, \
  and the elimination of suspected resistance cells. Eyewitnesses describe precision strikes backed by overwhelming \
  force - with little concern for collateral damage.</p>\
  <p>"Whatever they once were, they''re pirates now," said an anonymous source from the local resistance. "And they''re\
  \ getting paid to act like it."</p>\
  <p>Despite their clean operational record in previous engagements, their alignment with Tortuga''s anarchic \
  leadership has cast doubt on the long-term intentions of {1}. Political analysts warn this could \
  represent a shift in the market - where results trump ethics and loyalty bends toward whoever pays most.</p>\
  <p>A growing number of border systems are now flagging {1} as a "high-risk unaffiliated combat \
  element," with some planetary militias placing them on active watchlists.</p>\
  <p>As always in the Periphery, today''s hired gun can become tomorrow''s warlord. {1} may soon learn \
  that reputation is easier to spend than it is to restore.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.CS=<h2>{1} Quietly Deliver</h2>\
  In a time when chaos edges closer to the heart of every border \
  world, few names stir as much quiet confidence - and growing respect - as {1}, the military unit under the\
  \ command of {0}.\
  <p>Over the past several years, {1} have conducted high-value operations across dozens of conflict \
  zones, often stepping in where others falter. Their deployments are fast. Their outcomes are clean. Their \
  discretion is unmatched.</p>\
  <p>"They don''t posture. They don''t politic. They just solve problems," said one unnamed intelligence analyst \
  familiar with their recent work. "That''s what separates them from the rest."</p>\
  <p>While details of their backers, contracts, and logistics remain closely guarded, evidence of their work can be \
  found in improved trade security across several planets, the collapse of multiple destabilizing warlord coalitions, \
  and precise counterinsurgency support in systems too dangerous for traditional forces.</p>\
  <p>"They''re not mercs," said a source with insight into their operations. "They''re professionals. Someone, somewhere,\
  \ is trusting them with critical tasks - and they''re delivering."</p>\
  <p>With rumors swirling of deeper strategic engagements on the horizon, observers are beginning to wonder:</p>\
  <p>Who is the benefactor hiring {1}?</p>\
  <p>And more importantly - why do they keep winning?</p>\

FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.WOB=<h2>Blakist Ties Raise Concerns</h2>\
  Reports are emerging that the military unit known as \
  {1}, commanded by {0}, may have entered into operational alignment with none other than the \
  Word of Blake - the same fanatical sect responsible for the recent atrocities of the Jihad.\
  <p>While official confirmations remain scarce, multiple sources across fringe intelligence networks and planetary \
  security logs have flagged The Stakeholder''s activity in systems long thought to harbor Blakist remnants. Civilian \
  vessels report sightings of the unit escorting unidentified DropShips with masked transponders. Others claim to \
  have intercepted encrypted broadcasts referencing "Guided {1}" and "the Pattern''s Soldiers."</p>\
  <p>If these reports are accurate, they paint a chilling picture: a once-respected command may now be functioning as\
  \ hired guns for religious extremists.</p>\
  <p>Security analysts are warning that this could signal a dangerous new phase in the Word of Blake''s \
  strategy.</p>\
  <p>"This is how it starts," said Janell Asou, former militia captain turned conflict journalist. "You take a \
  disciplined unit, offer them money, doctrine, and mystery - and suddenly they''re not just fighting for contracts \
  anymore. They''re fighting for something far worse."</p>\
  <p>Multiple systems are now pushing for formal investigations, with some already labeling {1} a \
  "Blakist-adjacent force."</p>\
  <p>Whether they''re true believers or just well-paid deniers, the facts are piling up. And the question grows louder\
  \ across the Inner Sphere:</p>\
  <p>Where will {0} strike next - and who will they be preaching for when they do?</p>

  <p><b>[KhanSpaniel]</b>\
  <br>Just reviewed the logs. {1} were point on the assault. Heavy armor, clean approach, flawless \

  <hr>\
  <p><b>[Xx_BloodnameTaker69_xX]</b>\
  <br>Flawless retreat? That is not praise. Warriors do not retreat.</p>\
  <hr>\
  <p><b>[KhanSpaniel]</b>\
  <br>Incorrect. Warriors do not die pointlessly. They completed the objective, annihilated the opposition, and \
  disengaged under order to preserve resources for the next strike. Textbook command discipline.</p>\

  <p><b>[OathSteel_017]</b>\

  they have won six consecutive Trials of Position. No losses. Assigned to {1} by order of Loremaster.</p>\
  <hr>\
  <p><b>[Kiroth_Fire]</b>\
  <br>The name is odd. But the results speak. Their unit scored a 91% kill ratio in their most recent action. \

  <p><b>[Xx_BloodnameTaker69_xX]</b>\
  <br>Composite? Mixed castes?</p>\
  <hr>\
  <p><b>[KhanSpaniel]</b>\
  <br>Aff. Some tech-caste integration. No signs of corruption. In fact, {1} outperformed two trueborn \
  trinaries in coordination tests. Their mix works - because they enforce discipline ruthlessly.</p>\
  <hr>\
  <p><b>[RealNicolai]</b>\
  <br>{0} does not act like a traditionalist. That may trouble some. But results are results. Perhaps we \
  watch. Perhaps we challenge.</p>\
