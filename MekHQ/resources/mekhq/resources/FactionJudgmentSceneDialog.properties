FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.BARRED.MG=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The lights still worked. That was the insult that bit the deepest.</p>\
  <p>Overhead fluorescents buzzed to life as Commander Bob crossed the threshold of the empty hangar, his boots \
  echoing off concrete that had once pulsed with the rhythm of purpose. Now it was cavernous silence. Mek gantries \
  stood like skeletal remains - no ''Meks, just grease stains and dangling power cables swaying in a current of air that\
  \ wasn''t there.</p>\
  <p>He stopped halfway to Bay Three and looked up. That was where his favorite used to rest. Not a pretty ''Mek, but \
  it had kept more pilots alive more times than he could count. Took a blast to the torso - came back swinging. Marched\
  \ through the scrum like it was born there. Gone now.</p>\
  <p>Bob exhaled and tasted rust.</p>\
  <p>The fall started with the Guild.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>Failure to uphold operational standards. Contractual disputes. Blacklisted \
  indefinitely.</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>That was the line. No arbitration. No appeal. One morning, they were certified and legit. That evening, they \
  were untouchables. A hundred contracts gone with the stroke of an official seal.</p>\
  <p>No Guild meant no support, no access to certified contracts, and no employer who valued their neck would take the \
  risk. The ones who did? Desperate. Or dishonest. Or both.</p>\
  <p>Five jobs in a row - each worse than the last. One ended in an ambush. Another, they were paid in warehouse \
  vouchers that turned out to be fake. Two more were "delayed payments" that never came. And the last? The employer \
  ghosted them the minute the job was done.</p>\
  <p>He''d lost four pilots. Two to enemy fire. One to debt. One to shame.</p>\
  <p>Bob turned, hands behind his back, scanning the dead hangar like a general inspecting the field after the \
  retreat. Not a single sound except the soft mechanical clink of his own steps.</p>\
  <p>The Stakeholders were gone.</p>\
  <p>No ceremony. No last mission. Just dispersal. Drip by drip. Techs, MekWarriors, crew - each of them with that same\
  \ look when they told him goodbye:\
  <blockquote><p><i>It''s not your fault, Commander.</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>They meant it, but that didn''t help.</p>\
  <p>He sat on an empty tool crate and let the silence settle around him like a burial shroud. His hand hovered at \
  his jacket pocket. A flask. Still full. He didn''t drink it.</p>\
  <p>The Guild didn''t destroy the Stakeholders. It just opened the airlock and watched the pressure drop.</p>\
  <p>Bob leaned forward, elbows on knees, and muttered the only eulogy his unit would ever get:</p>\
  <p>"We kept the damn faith. But nobody pays for faith."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.BARRED.MRB=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>Two years gone, and still, he checked his messages every month. Just to see. Just in case.</p>\
  <p>This month was no different. The same flickering screen, the same login, the same silence.</p>\
  <p>Commander Bob sat alone at the edge of a rotting landing platform. No one came here unless they were running \
  from something, or already out of places to run. The cold bit through the insulation in his boots, but he didn''t \
  move.</p>\
  <p>He still had the message. Not the copy ComStar sent - he''d wiped that months ago. This was the one he''d \
  transcribed by hand, line by line, like some sacred text he couldn''t burn.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>Notice of Revocation: The ComStar Mercenary Review Board hereby withdraws accreditation from \
  the Stakeholders...</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>He could recite the rest from memory. He didn''t. He just folded the paper, slipped it back into the inside \
  pocket of his jacket, and stared out at the stars that never gave a damn.</p>\
  <p>The Stakeholders were gone. The DropShip had been stripped and sold. The equipment gutted for spare parts. The \
  crew scattered. Some found other units. Most didn''t.</p>\
  <p>No one sent invites. No one sent thanks.</p>\
  <p>The MRB hadn''t sent another word, either. No audit. No closure. Just that first message. Like they''d crossed a \
  line and vanished from the ledger. Bureaucratic erasure. As if the Stakeholders had never fought, bled, or \
  mattered.</p>\
  <p>Bob pulled the flask from his coat. He drank. Just one mouthful - enough to take the edge off the memory. Enough \
  to dull the echo of <i>"Effective immediately."</i></p>\
  <p>He didn''t blame ComStar anymore. They hadn''t fired the last shot. They''d just made sure no one else would hire \
  them to take another.</p>\
  <p>Far off, a cargo hauler blinked across the black sky. He watched it go, then leaned back against the platform''s \
  rusted railing and closed his eyes.</p>\
  <p>The Stakeholders were gone. But he was still here. And that, somehow, was worse.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.BARRED.MRBC=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The wind on the northern plateau was a thin, bitter thing - sharp enough to sting, but not strong enough to move \
  the past.</p>\
  <p>Commander Bob sat on the rusted frame of a broken sensor mast, his coat pulled tight, collar up. Below him, the \
  concrete bones of an abandoned airstrip stretched toward the horizon, cracked by time and sun. The Stakeholders had\
  \ bivouacked here once. Just a brief refit between jobs. Before it all fell apart.</p>\
  <p>It had started with the contracts. One late payment. One botched extraction. One planetary noble who used them \
  like bait and burned the clause. Then came the citation from the MRBC - a warning at first. Then a black mark. Then \
  the kill switch.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>Notice of Termination: The Mercenary Review and Bonding Commission hereby revokes accreditation for \
  the Stakeholders. Effective immediately. Further operations conducted under this banner will not be recognized or \
  protected by the MRBC.</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>That had been two years ago.</p>\
  <p>No one in the Inner Sphere touched a unit without MRBC backing unless they were desperate, criminal, or suicidal. \
  The Stakeholders tried to hang on. Took whatever jobs they could. Border skirmishes. Cargo escort runs with no \
  manifests. One job turned out to be a smuggling op; another didn''t pay at all.</p>\
  <p>By the end, Bob wasn''t running a company - he was shepherding wreckage. Pilots started leaving. Some without even \
  saying goodbye. Others looked him in the eye and apologized, like they were the ones walking away from a lost cause. \
  But none of them blamed him. That made it worse.</p>\
  <p>The last ''Mek they had went to a junk trader for parts. Even then, Bob had to lie about its operational status \
  just to close the deal.</p>\
  <p>He didn''t remember the day the Stakeholders ended. There was no line in the sand. No final battle. Just silence.\
  \ Missed comms. Empty bunks. A paycheck that never came and no one left to split it with.</p>\
  <p>Now it was just him. A commander with no command, watching frost gather on broken concrete in a forgotten corner\
  \ of the Periphery.</p>\
  <p>He reached into his coat and pulled out the old MRBC revocation notice. Printed hardcopy. Folded corners. A \
  crease down the middle where he''d gripped it too tightly once.</p>\
  <p>He read the words again. Not because he needed to, but because they reminded him that it hadn''t been a dream. \
  That the Stakeholders had been real. That they had mattered - if only for a while.</p>\
  <p>Bob looked up at the pale horizon. Somewhere beyond it, wars still raged. MekWarriors still fought. Units rose, \
  fell, signed contracts, cashed out. The machine turned without him now.</p>\
  <p>"We kept the terms. We fought clean. That should''ve counted."</p>\
  <p>It didn''t. And he knew that. But it was all he had left to say.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.BARRED.MBA=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>"Scan your cargo and step aside."</p>\
  <p>Bob said it like a mantra. The words came out without thought, worn smooth by repetition. Another day, another \
  freighter pilot with a manifest half-scribbled and a chip full of Sea Fox-preferred goods.</p>\
  <p>He stood behind the customs station. Once, he''d filed mission plans in war rooms. Now he flagged shipments of \
  industrial lubricants and sealant.</p>\
  <p>The pilot in front of him - a smug Lyran brat with mirrored glasses - didn''t even look up. Just waved a form and \
  said, "Should be cleared under priority seal."</p>\
  <p>Bob scanned the form. It pinged green. Of course it did.</p>\
  <p>"You''re good," he said, and slid it back. The kid swaggered off without a thank-you. The kid didn''t recognize him.\
  \ None of them did. That was the point.</p>\
  <p>He watched the man disappear into the access corridor, then leaned on the counter and let the next ship''s \
  manifest roll in. A dozen crates of actuators, stamped with the Clan Sea Fox''s stylized glyph. Battle-ready \
  components, bound for a unit that probably never heard of the Stakeholders.</p>\
  <p>No one had. Not anymore.</p>\
  <p>Bob didn''t miss the fighting - not really. He missed the command. The discipline. The sense that you were building\
  \ something. That your work mattered. Out here, everything had the weight of vapor. DropShips in. DropShips out. \
  C-Bills changed hands. Loyalty didn''t even enter the transaction.</p>\
  <p>That''s how the Foxes won. Not with fire and steel, like the old days. They came with contracts and lines of \
  credit. Made themselves indispensable. Didn''t matter that they were invaders once. Now they were logistics \
  partners, equity stakeholders, supply chain gods. And the Inner Sphere? They bent the knee and called it progress.</p>\
  <p>Bob reached under the counter and pulled out a worn datapad. No messages. No updates. No job offers. Just the \
  same automated ping from the MBA portal:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"Your unit is not recognized. MBA accreditation: revoked."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Two years old. He kept it saved. Not for hope. Just to remember who''d swung the axe.</p>\
  <p>"Next," he muttered. The line moved forward. He scanned another manifest. Another weapon shipment. Another \
  signature from a system that erased men like him and replaced them with logos.</p>\
  <p>Bob smiled, but only with his mouth.</p>\
  <p>"Enjoy your freedom," he thought. "Bought and paid for by Clan Sea Fox."</p>
