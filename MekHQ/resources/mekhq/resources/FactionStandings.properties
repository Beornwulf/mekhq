# BATCHALL STATEMENTS
## General
### Batchall Refused
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.0=TWhen a warrior refuses battle, they surrender more than\
  \ territory - they surrender their place in the legacy of combat. We offered you the honor of meeting steel with steel,\
  \ and you turned your face from the fire. Now you will feel it consume you, without witness, without honor, and without\
  \ pause.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.1=A batchall refused is a confession - a silent admission of\
  \ weakness. And so we will treat you not as an adversary but as prey. There will be no parley, no restraint, no record\
  \ of what you were. Only the certainty that nothing of you will remain when we are finished.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.2=You refused a binding challenge - an act unworthy of any\
  \ caste. Your cowardice places you outside the honor of zellbrigen. We respond with overwhelming force, and when the\
  \ dust clears, your name will carry the stench of dezgra. Such is the cost of defiance without courage.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.3=You have rejected the sacred rite. This is not a decision\
  \ - it is a sentence. Our forces are mobilized and will not be bound by ritual or honor. You are no longer recognized\
  \ as a warrior but as a target. The distinction is critical. And final.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.4=I would ask why you refused, but I already know the answer.\
  \ Fear has its own language, and you are fluent. You could have died well. Now, you will die badly, and worse - you will\
  \ be forgotten. Our assault begins now. Prepare to become irrelevant.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.5=Your refusal has been logged. You have removed yourself from\
  \ the ledger of warriors, and soon we will remove you from the map as well. What could have been a battle worthy of\
  \ song will become eradication. Nothing more. Nothing less.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.6={0} of {1} here. You declined our challenge, and so we decline to see you as\
  \ anything but a target. There will be no negotiation, no foregiveness, no honor gained. We do not wage war on those\
  \ who refuse war - we remove them.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.7=You had a chance to stand as a warrior and face your fate by\
  \ blade and fire. Instead, you chose to vanish behind silence and walls. All things fall eventually - but those who\
  \ fall in battle become legend. You will simply become dust.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.8=Enough words. You refused the challenge. So now we burn the offer and everything\
  \ near it. What could have ended cleanly will end in ash. We are not here to negotiate. We are here to take what you\
  \ feared to lose.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.9=Your refusal shames you. It denies you the one true measure of a warrior - trial\
  \ by combat. The spirits of our ancestors turn their backs to you. And so will we, once our boots have crushed what\
  \ remains. You have made your choice. We will make sure it is final.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.10=You refused our batchall, and in doing so, spat on the customs that separate\
  \ warriors from savages. You had the chance to meet us in combat, to test strength with strength. Instead, you chose\
  \ the path of fear. We will not offer again. Our forces advance now, and we come not as challengers - but as your\
  \ reckoning.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.11=We offered a path paved in honor. You chose to close that path and wall yourself\
  \ in cowardice. The batchall was your chance to stand and be counted. Now you will be measured not by your skill, but\
  \ by how long you can delay the inevitable. Prepare your defenses. We are coming, and we will not stop until your\
  \ command burns.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.12=Refusal has been recorded. You have forsaken the trial of combat and cast aside\
  \ the rites that govern true warriors. According to our laws, you are now considered without caste, without name, and\
  \ without worth. We will engage with full force, without restriction. There will be no victory for you - only\
  \ annihilation.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.13=You denied our challenge, and with it, the only honorable path left to you. You\
  \ may think this grants you an advantage - more time, more control. You are mistaken. You have only ensured that your\
  \ end will be brutal, total, and without honor. My Clan does not forget such insults. We will make an example of you.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.14={0} of {1} speaks. I am astounded. We extended the hand of tradition, and you\
  \ turned away. Why? Because you fear the outcome? Or because you never understood the strength required to face it? No\
  \ matter. You are no longer a combatant - you are an obstacle. And we are already moving to eliminate you. Quickly,\
  \ thoroughly, and with righteous fury.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.15=We offered you clarity through battle. You chose shadows and silence. In doing\
  \ so, you denied yourself the chance to meet your end with pride. Our warriors now come without restraint. No duels.\
  \ No negotiation. Just fire, steel, and the will to erase every trace of your failure from this world.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.16=Batchall refused. Then we proceed by doctrine - total force deployment. No\
  \ quarter, no pauses, no regard for your losses. You chose this outcome when you rejected the challenge. We will not\
  \ ask again. We will only act.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.17=In the end, all warriors must choose how they will be remembered. You had a\
  \ chance to face us, weapon to weapon, soul to soul. But you turned your back on that choice. Now you will not be\
  \ remembered as a warrior, but as rubble beneath our treads. I take no joy in this - but I will ensure your name does\
  \ not linger.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.18={0} of {1} here. You refused a direct challenge under the laws of zellbrigen.\
  \ That leaves us only one path: full assault. You will not see order or structure. You will see our forces descend like\
  \ flame upon dry grass. There will be no glory for either side - only the brutal efficiency of war unleashed.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.19=You had a moment, a chance to claim a place among those who stood for something.\
  \ You could have met us with courage and fire. Instead, you chose silence. Your name will not be etched in stone. It\
  \ will not be sung. It will vanish, forgotten in the ash of what we destroy. We are coming now, and your end is\
  \ already written.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.20=The offer was made. The path of warriors laid before you. And you turned away.\
  \ What you refuse in ritual, we will take in ruin. Our forces come not to test you but to erase you. No formalities\
  \ remain - only fire.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.21=You refused our batchall. In doing so, you cast aside the only thread of honor\
  \ available to you. There will be no second chance. What comes now is not war - it is removal. Swift. Unrelenting.\
  \ Absolute.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.22=You have declined to face us in trial. So understand: you are no longer seen as\
  \ a warrior, but as a stain to be cleansed. No parley, no structure, no pause. We will end this in the most efficient\
  \ way possible. And when the burnt husk of your command comes crumbling down, remember: you chose this.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.23=A challenge was issued. It was refused. And so, the rite is broken. What comes\
  \ next is not bound by the traditions of the Clans. It is bound only by our purpose. Your forces will be engaged\
  \ without quarter, without honor, and without song. This ends without your name.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.refused.24=I had hoped you would face us. That you would rise. That you would choose the\
  \ warrior's path. Instead, you cowered behind silence. Now we descend - not in anger, but in certainty. You had a\
  \ chance to be remembered. You chose to vanish.
### Batchall Not Possible
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.0=This is {0} of {1}. We will not issue a batchall. You are dezgra - your\
  \ actions have stripped you of any claim to honor, tradition, or the right to stand in the circle of warriors. To\
  \ challenge you would be to legitimize your existence. We will engage you as one puts down a rabid beast: without\
  \ ceremony, without pause, and without remorse.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.1={0} of {1} speaking. There will be no batchall. You have disgraced yourself\
  \ beyond even the lowest castes. You are no longer seen as a warrior, but as a mistake that must be corrected. To honor\
  \ you with formal combat would tarnish every warrior who has ever stood in the Circle of Equals. You will face our wrath\
  \ not as an equal but as vermin beneath our boots. And when you fall, the only sound will be silence.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.2=This is {0} of {1}. By the judgment of your deeds and the stain you carry,\
  \ you have been found unworthy of challenge. We do not issue batchalls to the disgraced, for to do so would imply you\
  \ still walk the path of the warrior. You do not. The laws of the Clans are clear: those who violate honor are removed,\
  \ not reasoned with. Prepare yourself. We come not to test you, but to erase what remains of your name.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.3=I am {0} of {1}. You seek the structure of a batchall, the illusion of\
  \ worth. It is denied. Your name is tainted, your record a trail of shame. We do not grant ritual combat to the\
  \ disgraced. We grant them fire, steel, and finality. There will be no negotiation, no limits, and no record of your\
  \ death. You had a place among warriors once. Now you are simply the target of a necessary purge.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.4=This is {0} of {1}. You approach expecting tradition, as if it still binds\
  \ you. But you forfeited that the moment you earned the mark of dezgra. We do not elevate the fallen. We erase them.\
  \ A batchall would legitimize your presence - it would suggest you still matter. You do not. Our response is not a\
  \ challenge. It is a sentence. And you will not leave the battlefield with anything that resembles legacy.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.5=I am {0} of {1}. We offer trials to warriors, not to the disgraced. The\
  \ path of honor was before you, and you abandoned it. Now you ask for a batchall? You insult every Bloodnamed warrior\
  \ who has died in the Circle. No. You will be given no such dignity. We do not honor traitors, scavengers, or cowards.\
  \ We cleanse them. And when we find you, we will not stop until even your memory is erased from our records.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.6={0} of {1} here. You still think you're owed a challenge? That you deserve\
  \ a warrior's death? You chose dishonor. You earned the mark of dezgra with every broken oath, every shameful act. You\
  \ don't get to crawl back into the Circle now and pretend. No batchall. No trial. Just the sharp end of everything you\
  \ turned your back on. We will find you, and we will end you. And not a single warrior will speak your name again.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.7=This is {0} of {1}. Our ways are governed by trial, tradition, and truth.\
  \ You no longer live under those laws. You chose a different path - one without ritual, without purpose, without honor.\
  \ To offer you a batchall would be to poison the very foundation of what we are. You are not an opponent, you are an\
  \ error. And what is flawed must be corrected. Not through challenge. Through obliteration.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.8=I am {0} of {1}. Your status is no longer in question. You are dezgra,\
  \ and thus, beneath formal challenge. We do not negotiate with disgraced warriors. We do not speak the ritual words\
  \ to those who turned their backs on the code. You are no longer an enemy. You are a liability. Our orders are clear:\
  \ you will be removed with maximum efficiency. There will be no honor in your defeat. There will only be silence.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.9={0} of {1} speaking. How many times were you warned? How many chances to\
  \ turn back, to prove yourself, to stand upright in the Circle? You threw them away, and now you come looking for\
  \ structure, for meaning? There is none for you. You are beyond the code, and so we will respond without it. No trial.\
  \ No challenge. Just the swift and brutal ending your actions earned.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.10=I am {0} of {1}. Your name once held weight. Now, it is a weight we carry\
  \ only long enough to bury it. You want to fight with honor, now, at the end? It is too late. You are outside the\
  \ code. Outside tradition. Outside the Clan. No batchall will be issued. No warrior will be called. Just fire until\
  \ even the land you stand on forgets your footfalls.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.11={0} of {1} speaking. To issue a batchall would mean we recognize you.\
  \ That you are something. That you matter. But you are outside all measures now - reputation, record, and ritual. You\
  \ have placed yourself in exile, and we merely complete what you began. You will not be challenged. You will be erased.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.12=This is {0} of {1}. There is no batchall. I say that not with satisfaction,\
  \ but with sorrow. I once saw the spark of greatness in you. I believed you would fight with honor, stand for something.\
  \ But whatever path you were on, you abandoned it. You made your choice. And now I must make mine. I will not grant you\
  \ the glory of a duel. I will give you only justice. Swift. Absolute. Unforgiving.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.13=This is {0} of {1}. No batchall will be spoken. No challenge will be given.\
  \ You are beyond that now. You are not a warrior in our eyes. You are a wound in our history, one we now intend to\
  \ cauterize. We do not offer you combat. We offer you silence, fire, and the certainty that nothing you built will\
  \ survive you.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.14=I am {0} of {1}. One day, the Loremasters may ask why we did not issue a\
  \ batchall this day. The answer is simple: your actions have buried any claim to honor. You fell, and now we step over\
  \ what's left. We offer no duel, no trial, no song. Just a final act of erasure, one our histories will not bother to\
  \ record.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.15=This is {0} of {1}t. I will not speak a batchall. That rite is reserved\
  \ for those who uphold our ways, not for those who treat honor like a costume - worn when convenient, discarded when\
  \ inconvenient. You have made your intentions clear through your actions. Now we make ours clear in return. We will\
  \ not meet you as warriors. We will remove you as a threat. Methodically. Without pause. Without mercy. And without\
  \ regret.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.16=This is {0} of {1}. A batchall is a signal of respect - of structure and\
  \ parity. You have shown none, and so you shall receive none. We will not risk a single warrior in ritual combat with\
  \ one so undeserving. You will be destroyed, not in glory, but in silence. No warning. No duel. Just the full weight\
  \ of Clan firepower descending without mercy or restraint.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.17=I am {0} of {1}. I name you not ally, not rival, not even enemy. You are\
  \ other - an exile in deed and in spirit. A batchall is a rite of recognition, and I do not recognize you. You have no\
  \ claim to our customs, no place in our structure. You will not be answered with ritual. You will be answered with\
  \ violence. Complete and uncompromising.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.18={0} of {1} speaking. When my Clan crossed swords with you, they did so\
  \ with purpose. With pride. With discipline. You returned none of these things. To challenge you now would desecrate\
  \ their memory. And so, I will not. There will be no batchall. No formal rite. Only fire and fury, unleashed not as a\
  \ test of strength, but as a cleansing.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.19=This is {0} of {1}. Under our laws, there are words that must never be\
  \ spoken to the disgraced. You will hear no batchall from us. You have cast yourself out. You have made a mockery of\
  \ every code, every rite, every bond that holds our kind together. To acknowledge you would taint our legacy. So we\
  \ will not speak your name. We will not offer you battle. We will strike with precision and permanence, and when we\
  \ are done, it will be as though you never existed.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.20=This is {0} of {1}. Your standing is null. Your actions speak louder than\
  \ any plea for tradition. A batchall is not a weapon you can wield to save face. It is a rite we grant to those who\
  \ deserve it. You have proven you do not. There will be no Circle. No terms. No witness. Only destruction - and it will\
  \ be as swift and absolute as your fall.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.21=This is {0} of {1}. The Trial of Refusal has already passed. The judgment\
  \ has been rendered. You are dezgra - cast out, unwanted, unredeemable. You carry no legacy, command no respect, and\
  \ have no place on the battlefield as a warrior. I will not grant you a batchall. That privilege belongs to those who\

factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.22=I am {0} of {1}. You stand outside the firelight of our kin. There is no\
  \ warmth for you, no welcome, no challenge to prove your strength. You are a shadow cast by failure, wandering a world\
  \ you no longer belong to. A batchall would be a lie - a suggestion that you matter. And we do not lie. We do not duel\
  \ with ghosts. We erase them.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.23={0} of {1} speaking. A warrior lives and dies by ritual. It binds us. It\
  \ tests us. But ritual has limits, and you have stepped far beyond them. Your name is spoken now only in warning, not\
  \ in respect. There is no batchall for the fallen. Only the storm. We will come at you not as warriors, but as\
  \ executioners with no need for honor, no interest in glory. Just a singular purpose: to see your stain washed from\
  \ the field forever.
factionStandingLevel.batchall.tooLowStanding.24=This is {0} of {1}. You misunderstand. A batchall is not a favor we owe\
  \ you. It is a rite we extend only to those who earn it. You have not. You have spent every shred of that currency,\
  \ and now your debt is paid in blood. You are not an enemy. You are an insult. We will meet you without formality,\
  \ without code, and without pause. No one will question why. No one will speak your name when it's done.
